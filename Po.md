**Lines** cannot move autonomously if there's another friendly piece in a surrounding hex, only in the hex surrounding the friendly piece(s). Realignment is not necessary then.
If a **Line** is alone, it can move four tiles in any direction so long as the line in the piece is currently aligned in said direction. Realigning the line takes one turn.

**Squares** can only be moved to any tile touching their own, or jump to any of the surrounding same-coloured tiles if it's to mount another piece.

**Triangles** can move to any tile touching their own, or to any of the six closest same-colored tiles.

--------------

If a piece is mounted on top of a **line**, the mounting piece can be thrown between one and five tiles ahead instead. Realigning the line in the piece is still necessary.

----------------

**Squares** can be mounted on top of another piece. If this piece is attacked the **square** will be destroyed, the mounted-on piece will survive, and the attacker will be moved one hex further in a straight line.

**Squares** can be mounted from a distance if thrown with **lines** and pieces with **squares** can be thrown as well, but the square will be knocked off one tile further. Pieces can be thrown from a line to the other.

----------------

Any piece will be destroyed on falling off the board.
Other pieces are destroyed by contact.
