Sedna. True name: ???
Possibly acts as a buffer/Arbiter
between Vorbis' duties and the
lady's carefree nature. Described
as a lake of all things, which I
am still confused about.

Vorbis. True name: ???
It seems to be a guardian of sorts,
As close to the lady as it can to
protect her from any intruders.
Seems roughly equivalent to 


???. True name: Dons-ler.
This star is almost impossible to
see. I have not found any info
regarding it other than a passing
mention in the wooden diaries.

Lenli. True name: Khirkhibi.
The lady's oldest twinkle,
inhabiting it's most precious
star. Implied to be Leo's
father, and possibly related
to phoenix.










Leo. True name: Nikkal-wa-Ib.
The lord's guardian. Related
to the Nikkal storm? It's 
also implied to be Lenli's
child. Very dangerous, do
NOT name.

Corvi. True name: ???
A guide, and possibly a
nurturer as well. Or a
guardian, no one seems
to decide on which and
sometimes it changes
within the same story.
Might be approachable?


Cassiopeia. True name: Scheda.
The brightest of them all. Maybe
related to Leo somehow? Griffon
mythology describes them as
"mutual growth" in Schede Naid,
whatever that means. It seems to
have the sole function of giving
beauty and/or removing ugliness?

Lyra. True name: ???
Changeling lore describes it
as a song that thinks. Not
even a twinkle, just a song.
