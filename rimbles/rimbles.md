Rimbles dreamt that the world was a dragon.

 “Why do you sleep?” He asked, seeing that its eye, the size as a country, was closed.

And the dragon was silent for ages, as its thoughts moved tectonic plates.

 “My hunger was too great,” It muttered at last, drifting between dreams, when Rim had grown old. “I delay my perishing.”

When Rim awoke, his colleagues laughed much at the fancies of his imagination, and asked what would then happen if the great dragon would decide to awake. But Rim was not known for his foresight, and had not thought of asking.

 “If I am the world,” It began, and every word was a quake, “What do I have to step on?”

In the first day of the second moon of his third year, young Rimbles wandered off the halls of his home as his aunts, who he had no desire to be pinched by, were visiting.

His stumbling brought him to a beach where a siren laid, her face split by the mismatching reflection of half a small beak and half a large snout, and a half of her body covered in wet, discolored feathers while the other had dry, cracked scales.

 “What are you doing?” He asked.

 “Denying.” She replied with a hoarse voice.

 “Denying what?”

 “My nature.”

And Rimbles sat on the sand, his stubby legs tired after stumbling.

 “Is your nature to deny?”

This time it was the siren who sat to think. If she had any answer to this Rimbles never knew it, as he grew bored and walked away before she gave it.

One a day that the sky belched and roared and the air was hot, Rimbles sought refuge under the canopy of a forest. He was not known for his foresight, and grew lost in its twists and turns chasing butterflies.

After a time looking for his path again, he found a person who had fallen asleep, surrounded by butterflies. They all fluttered away, and the commotion made him awake and sneeze.

 “I dreamt I was a butterfly.” He said to no one in particular, although he noticed Rimbles a moment after. “Or I may dreaming not to be one.”

 “Would the answer be of any use?” Asked Rimbles.

The person conceded it might not, and chased butterflies with Rimbles.

------------------------------

Rimbles set out to find a home.

The first one he found had many rooms in which dust gathered, which dissatisfied him as he could not rest or eat in such a place; The attic was filled with so many things the door could not be opened, and dust rained down from it.

The second he found was clean and had many glass galleries in which to dine, but wind and rain poured into the galleries and vermin would often come from a nearby home.

The third he found had no vermin, was clean, and had glass jars windows of many colors and shapes. But Rimbles was not known for his foresight, and he stumbled and hurt himself; This house, although it’d been pretty from a distance, had too many fragile things for one such as him.

At last he sat near a homeless man, who asked him what woes could make his face so long.

 “My first house was too dusty, and I could not open the door to clean it.”

 “Then,” said the homeless man, “You could have used a window.”

 “The second had mice and bats, coming in from elsewhere.”

 “You could have asked that place to get rid of the rats, or built a wall they could not climb. And then?”

Rimbles completely missunderstood the question, and kept talking his woes, “The third one seemed beautiful, but was too delicate for me.”

 “Or maybe, you were too rude for it.” He said, and then kicked Rimbles away.

And long after Rimbles found a home, but that is another story.


------------------------------

Rimbles, who attempted to meditate in his home of homes, had a guest.

The guest had many words: His first home had been beset by insects, buzzing and pestering and ruining all his food. The second had suffered a similar fate, the third looked upsetingly like his father's, and the fourth been eclipsed by an old rival's. Finally Rimbles grew tired of such echoes, and politely walked out of his home of homes pulling his guest out along with him, and they parted ways.

After much wandering Rimbles found a bench near a beach to rest his legs in which an impoverished monk rested, watching the sand. He watched the man watch the sand but, before long, grew bored and turned to watch the waves instead
