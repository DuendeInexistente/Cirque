 - Nelumbo / Lotus seed

Bittersweet or salty depending on the region it comes from, nelumbo is an ingredient in most foods for how common it is. It's sometimes cooked inside its shell, but it's not edible by itself in most recipes.

 - Caltrop / Minotaur's head

A nut-like seed with a shape reminding of a minotaur's head, and tips sharp enough to hurt skin. Inside it there's a sweet-tasting seed, which can be soaked in liquors or roasted, maybe after leaving in salt water fortnight.

 - Heartnut / Muck's Gift

A corn that grows in muck, reputed for how pestilent it has to be for the plant to grow properly in it, it's easy to find for the leafless canes that grow to the surface. The corn itself is a blood-like dark red, and thought the canes that grow of it and the wood of the corn are both edible, their taste and texture varies from deeply unpleasant and with an habit to get stuck in one's teeth to vomit-inducing. Because of this it's a mistery how did someone think the inside of the corn would be pleasant in any way to eat.

Despite this the inside of the seed -a white-green mass that meshes with the bark of the outter shell- is bitter and eye-watering acidic, but refreshing and an acquired taste for some, and gains a sweet taste if boiled in stews.

 - Taro

One of the largest plants known to the seas and the only succulent plant that Leaf has found so far, this succulent is completely edible. The leaves are the main dish, and are, once dried and made into a dust, a common spice. It's also used to wrap meats or other vegetables in some foodstores, as a courtesy or generosity.

Each leaf is usually eaten fresh, on the average twice the size of a pony's head at it's biggest and with a vague heart-like shape, is spicy, juicy, and filled with enough nutrients that it's usually eaten to prevent scurvy.

While theoretically possible to cook it, it's usually eaten together with salads, with other juicy and sweet leaves and meats to make its burning taste more tolerable for children.
