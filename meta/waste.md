*The sea is the world in which [Cirquesque](anonpone.com/cirquesque) takes place. It has no special name for the same reason we call earth that way— nobody cares. In it, several species attempt to survive in a world with resources and economies so dwindling that war cannot be sustained, making use of every resource available and building happyness from wimsy.*

*In the sea, as the name implies, there’s no land to speak of and there’s not been since ancient times. Gods remember a time when it was, and desire to bring it back, but they are not telling anymore than that.*


#Waste disposal in the sea.

There’s *much* background material in Cirque that doesn’t get used. Sometimes it’s because I lack the skill/energy to do so [^towns], sometimes, I never had the chance to explore it.

In this case, it was not only entirely divorced from the narrative- mater of fact it’s firmly planted in *those things you just don’t worry about in fiction*, because it’s yucky.

But good luck getting my brain to give a damn about that. So this is what happens with the trash and under the shitter in the sea.

##Down the poop-it hole

Landly is unique among most cities of temperate waters in that it actually *has* sewers, owing to it being a single chunk of solid, floating stone built long before recorded history. These sewers, after a long, arduous, and unknown[^cursedsew] process, expell a small, safe amount of highly toxic black ooze deep in the sea.

But Landly is the exception to this. Even in warm waters (Which are so shallow that city waste will make a difference quickly) some small towns are too poor to afford sewage systems, which is enough to say that sewers aren’t particularly cheap or easy in the sea. Cold/template water cities have a simple, utilitarian solution to this, in the form of *sewage bells*.

Maybe you’re guessing where I am going with this now, but in case you don’t, imagine floating house that has, under it, a large bell made of light ceramics— something like china but more resilient, maybe glassed to make it impermeable.

There are several designs for the sewage bells -in cold waters they are wider and shorter, to cover a large area of the flooring and heat it- but they all work in the same principle— keeping the shit in one place. As it decomposes and is eaten by local fauna, it losses buoyancy and falls down to the bottom of the sea.

It’s not a *perfect* approach (Anyone with common sense knows better than to drink or swim on cities) it’s still a *practical* one. There’s no logs floating around and the gross of pollution is somewhat contained until it goes away on its own, enough that they won’t spread sickness or produce unseemly smells. This infrastructure works with the seas lifestyle much better than sewers as we know them, as well, because it allows buildings to move around freely.

In warm waters the sewers need tubing instead, particularly in the most shallow areas

But we’ve not gone deeply enough yet, because my brain hates me and so may you.

[Some farms use shitwater to fertilize their terraces]
[What happens to trash?][If it floats for too long it’s attached to weights and forced to sink?][Or tied in packs and sent to float around until it sinks on its own?]

[^towns]:
Arabesco was supposed to be much more vibrant and colorful. This is one of the things that slid off to the wayside.

[^cursedsew]:
It’s hard to research how do your sewers work when they are cursed and you’re too busy keeping all the entrances surrounded by guards who must keep pyres around the gates stoked all day every day, lest *the sick* escapes.
