And so it flowed between the triangle: praise be nelumbo that our life be birthed; praise be the sun flower that our life be sparkled; praise be the moon smegma that our life be soothed. So it flowed between the three and so flowed with a rhythm that was the first music in our world: and music it was that rose us from the water so that we may now dance with bigheaded stallions for my mirth, and so that we may dance with swinging flanks for the stallions mirth as well, and we may both dance with big smilesrfcx. VB  and rosy cheeks and that our swinging and dancing and loving may please nelumbo and make the sun flower look away in shame, or the moon smegma look closer with curiosity.

 Why do griphfrons keep asking me this?

Who planted 'alegria' everywhere that's sacred? It's in every church that has power and -albeit transliterated- in so many ones that once had it. What was it? Who loves it so much? Why is it d yet is not mentioned in any sacred text, apocrypha, or religion? And why do I feel it's all a joke played at my expence, breadcrumbs to nothingness?

I got purply again.







First came the stars: And from them was birthed their father, for all was naught and life was upside down. Their shine was the first hint of light to be seen, and the one that guided the moon to it's first orbit. It was with this that night was made.

Once that the moon had come the light was too weak still, so the moon fell with an aching song but he hung by the thin silver threads that the stars had strung around his neck, and his swinging from the threads was the second orbit of the moon: ????? in their own tongue or ??????????????? [tong^]


And with the swaying and swinging of the father-son a firmness-before-the-moon was needed, so next came the elder sister: twilight, stone-and-mortar. Twilight had no orbits or swaying and hung from no threads that it did not choose to, and it was in this firmness and confidence that she became liaison between god and mortal, and the first holder of the spark.

Being preceded by twilight gave the night moon respite for he could now lay his legs on her land, and he trashed much less as he swung. This was his third orbit.
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ And this one doesn't have weird names too?

Twilight then tried to use her spark to lay light upon the land so that the minds and hearts of all could see: (--->)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Where are mortals made in this whole creation myth? The lack of explanation on the mater is something very typical gri~~ph~~ffonish myth, but at the same time night being the first to exist is almost exclusive of moonlet lore. Not to mention, I am not sure moonlets existed at the time this was writen.

(<---) But the spark, however nurtured it was, was not made for such things.(--->)
		 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		What was it made for then? Is this related to the rose church's spark?

	(---)And while twilight understood that she had misused the spark and nearly broken it, she was greatly displeased not because of her own misuse, but because of the inadequacy of her tools.

And this is why the first halves of the dualities were flawed.






Which one? Whose? What is this talking about even?
