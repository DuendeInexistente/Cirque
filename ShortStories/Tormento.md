# Como una hoja en el tormento

Celestia sat on the hill, her eyes unusually lost as rain poured arround her.

*Lloran los montes lloran los rios,*

What was she supposed to do now? As the rain poured, that question came time and time again to her: She did not need to eat all that often, so it was a very long time that she spent thinking.

*Y nunca llegu√© a pedir perdon.*

The sun was out, and spun in regular circles in spite of all the conditions. In that way she was meeting her purpose, and thus she was objectively not required by anything or anyone to do anything more than she already did.

*Este es mi monte, desierto y baldio,*

But that wasn't how it worked, was it? She had a personality now, and that meant certain responsibilities-- not responsibilities to anyone, or to anything tangible. It quite literally meant intangible self impossed responsibilities to intangible abstract concepts, one of which was herself- her pride and her empathy. And this endless rain wounded her pride, and every time she saw someone else it hurt her empathy.

*Prestame tu corazon*

So she stood.

She wasn't sure of what was she supposed to do, but she stood amidst the runny earth filled with long-since-dead grass, a groove where her flank had been, and shook in the rain until all mud had gone away from all those awkward -but still welcome- parts that physicality gave her. 

*Y en el zumbido de los tambores,

Vamos a despertar.

la madre tierra nos dio el honor,

Para este carnaval.*

She wasn't going to die, so the trying could only succeed. Only a mater of time.
