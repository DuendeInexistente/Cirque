# In a lighthouse...

Wind roared around the lighthouse. It always did at this height, but some days the unicorn mare just couldn't ignore the sound still. A lifetime of practice at it wasn't enough, maybe. Or maybe she was just slow.

Or maybe the wind was a constant, unrelenting reminder of what'd happen if she failed, if she fell asleep from boredom or just plain forgot to keep the magical fire alighted or to turn the focal mirrors, of what'd happen if a ship hit their rocky shoals, the amount of spurn the family would get; and with righteous reason, that, if she was lazy or dumb enough to fail at what really were simple tasks.

 "Lady Fireclay."

She turned around from the brickwork window in front of her with a start, her hairs standing on end and not only because of the faint static in the air that had come with her family's guest. Yellow had a way to do that sometimes.

The small, edgy Duda was coated in a mix of faded yellow paint and red rust that the family always tried desperately to keep at bay, on four detached legs with their bottom tips angled inwards like a scorpion's. At some point in the past yellow had flown instead, but now it walked as a result of 'Non-interrelative levitation systems becoming damaged beyond practical usability' and would skulk around, 'collecting data' for whatever was that it did so, it's walking always slightly off and slightly disjointed and, in truth, everyone was convinced that yellow was slowly going insane. It wasn't any particular action, just the undergoing offness of someone you've known your entire life changing in subtle but unnerving ways that words could explain but not convey the importance of.

 "Lord yellow." She said out of compromise, expecting the answer.

 "This unit does not recognize nor need titles, but is honoured." Said lord yellow like it had to every member of her family for the last three generations. "Have you found news regarding Citizen Lettuce Leaf."

 "No." She said truthfully. Over a century now and still they had not heard anything: It induced a running, unstated but nonetheless *increasing* panic in the family to realize that if Citizen had ever been real, he was long since dead now. "I haven't."

And no one knew what would lord yellow do when it found out, or was forced to acknowledge, this fact.

And then lord yellow did something that, to Fireclay's knowledge, it had never done:

 "Are you sure." it questioned her. Or asked, Fire didn't know, because yellow always spoke plainly and, if it ever took offence in something, it was a small and secret sort of offence that to lords and ladies was much more scary than any bout of revenge. "Have you sought answers from locally lodged travellers."

 "Yes." She lied with the expertise that being nobility -even an overall minor one, subservant to the actual Lady of the city- gave her. But in reality, why ask? Why seek answers that in a hundred years had yet to come? It was an exercise in futility, it was.

 "Are you sure." At times yellow seemed to find it fit to draw a face on his circle plate, but not now. Now, it stared at her from the depths of it's own systems and machinations plain and unreadable.

 "Yes, lord yellow. Have we ever lied to you?" The heat from the pyre seemed so much hotter than usual tonight, blasting her like a furnace.

 "Is that a captious question."

Lady Fireclay almost twitched, almost allowed a second of hesitation to wonder if this was a question or captious on it's own, but a lifetime of seeing her friend and confidante grow insane had taught her not to:

 "No, lord yellow." She said without a pause in spite of the heat, turning the lighthouse's focal mirrors on their pivots. "It's not."

Yellow looked at -she supposed- her horn and then at the mirrors, and looked at the pyre. "Allow me to assist."

 "There is no need--"

Yellow climbed the brickwork, it's legs awkward but somehow still precise and sharp, and helped her push with was -even for people used to it- a surprising amount of strength for such a little thing, the flame licking it's metal that somehow did not redden from it. "The mirrors have been aligned at the appropriate angle. Lady's Firework adherence to schedule remains steadfast."

And in spite of all Firework couldn't help smiling, because it was the exact same compliment, verbatim, that yellow had offered ever since she was a filly still learning the spells that kept the lighthouse's magical flame alive. Yellow never told her this when there was someone else around, just in their private moments. "Thankee, lord yellow."

 "This unit does not recognize nor require titles, but it is honoured." Yellow hopped down to the tiled floor, "Does the assistance have value equivalent to or greater to that of a hug." It stated-or-maybe-asked.

Fireclay blinked a few times, surprised by this, before answering. "Yellow, you're red-- You're too hot."

And yellow also paused at this, then said. "This unit is aware of it's temperature." It paused for a split second, then turned around to walk out of the room, it's leg rods starting to sparkle. "This unit will now continue readying to assist with the bug season."

 "Yellow, I can still hug you later." Rushed to say Fireclay, still surprised by how off yellow was being today. "If you really wanted it."

Yellow paused, and suddenly draw a simple face on it's circle plate.

 "This unit trusts Lady Fireclay to adhere to her schedule" It said, then walked out of the room. It's legs clack-clack-clacked against the stairs on it's way down.

And after a moment Fireclay turned around, and continued to stand watch over the city below.

# ...somewhere high...

An exact Equestrian year after it had last done so, pink_unit -mechanical ambassador, medic class, resource user version alpha three point zero point five point one point nine variant dee- shook into motion. Power that usually cycled only to prevent damage of it's systems started galloping through it's copper and gold veins like a stampede of horses and, even in a an atmosphere with low enough oxygen to slow down oxidation, exuded about as much heat in the process of booting up from hibernation. The light ceramic alloys that the tower was made of clicked softly from the temperature. On the stairs that climber up to this floor, a pilgrim felt the heat and decided to come back later.

In it's crystalline pseudopositronic brain, data flowed into motion as the complex-enough class intelligence that resided started processing a year's worth of collected data. Wind speed, words heard idly by it's wandering pieces, air density to calculate height, shifting of star maps to calculate trajectory, the prayers of visitors, it all flowed and was rearranged in arbitrary combinations to try finding coinciding facts at insane speeds that true intelligence wouldn't have allowed. 

This happened in the space of almost an hour, only four of Pink_unit's pieces there with it: the two halves of it's circle plate and the two largest rays. Below on the back of the city, the three smaller rays it had left crawled with semi-independant complex-enough intelligences seeking information, so Pink_Unit recalled them: As every time, protocol required that the wandering pieces did not stop their information seeking unless absolutely necessary. As every time, Pink_Unit's hardware simply *wasn't enough* to reprocess a year's worth of information in a reasonable timeframe without all of it's pieces -each with it's own brain simile- gathered together.

Pink_Unit was incapable of feeling frustration about protocol so crassly mismatching it's hardware specifications.

Technically all this information had been processed by the non-intelligence that composed Pink_Unit during hibernation, but protocol required self-optimization of procedures and Pink_Unit had found the non-intelligence to be insufficient for proper analysis beyond basic calculations: It simply wasn't as good at the arbitrary information-matching that was required for expanding separate facts into a larger awareness of the world, or at properly tagging important information.

Or, if those made of meat had wanted to drawn somewhat shallow comparisons, Pink_Unit -Some called it Punk- simply needed a while to reflect about things.

Punk collected three most relevant facts from this, aside from the city's current trajectory:

 - ***Fact***: The city-state of Arabesco had been destroyed in an event that has too many varying and unmatching stories. 
     + **Addendum**: Taint-type beasts seem to have been involved.
     + **Addendum**: Descriptions of involved pegasi have a degree of coincidence with Equestrian weather manipulation.
         * **Addendum**: Citizen Lettuce Leaf was not reported to be acknowledgeable regarding weather manipulation.
         * **Decision**: Recollect more information regarding the pegasus involved in the destruction of Arabesco.
     + **Decision**: Recollect versions of the story during the course of the next hibernation period as social hysteria diminishes.
     + **Decision**: Request Citizen Chundra, Citizen Cypress, and pilgrims for verifiable data if or when they visit.
     + **Decision**: Inform Yellow_Unit of this development. Compare compiled data.
 - ***Fact***: Citizen Sliver had not yet returned with the promised data.
     + **Addendum**: Current delay: Eight years.
     + **Decision**: Request Citizen Cypress for verifiable data if she visits.
     + **Decision**: Attempt to locate depending on the outcome of the following fact.
 - ***Fact***: Radio frequencies from Purple_Unit, Orange_Unit, Cyan_Unit and White_Unit detected bouncing from the higher atmosphere.
     + **Addendum**: The chaos of the local higher atmosphere makes vectorization of origins impossible with current equipment impossible.
     + **Addendum**: White_Unit has repeatedly requested yellow-grade SOS.
         * **Decision**: Protocol 626 will be applied.
     + **Addendum**: Cyan_Unit's distorted messages may reflect extremely damaged systems.
         * **Decision**: Cyan_Unit's status tagged as red alert.
     + **Addendum**: Orange_Unit's messages indicate that it is now actively seeking other units.
     + **Addendum**: Purple_Unit's messages indicate that it has found Citizen Lettuce Leaf and is now actively seeking other units.
     + **Conflict**: Moving from current position may result in data regarding the units position becoming useless, thus rendering any search mutually unproductive.
     + **Possible decision**: Attempt to find other units while leaving a clear trail of this unit's path.
         * **Addendum**: Retrieval of White_Unit or Cyan_Unit marked as two highest priorities, applying protocol 626 if necessary.
         * **Issue**: No available equipment would be as easy to find as this unit's radio systems.
             - **Addendum**: Production of required equipment rendered impossible by inadequacy of local materials and White_Unit's continued absence.
     + **Possible decision**: Remain in position.
         * **Issue**: Other units may also make this decision.
             - **Decision**: Report this conflict to Princess Twilight Sparkle at earliest convenience, advising that she assigns predefined stand-or-seek roles.
             - **Possible decision**: Coordinate with Orange_Unit and Purple_Unit to inform it of current position, predefining stand-or-seek roles.
                 + **Issue**: Orange_Unit has not yet communicated awareness of local coordinate system.
                 + **Issue**: Purple_Unit has communicated awareness of local coordinate systems, but this knowledge seems to be flawed and/or too partial.
                 + **Issue**: Atmospheric bouncing of radio signals is too unreliable. No unit has as of yet answered to any attempt of bridging communication.
             - **Possible decision**: Coordinate with Yellow_Unit to predefine stand-or-seek roles.
                 + **Issue**: Yellow_Unit is too damaged to seek and has displayed failures on it's emitting radio systems that cannot be repaired without White_Unit's assistance, as well as having it's own position to await other units from.
                 + **Issue**: Current position of Yellow_Unit is three days, two hours, fifteen minutes from current position of Pink_Unit. Coordination may prove complicated.

Pink_Unit was still for several minutes, pseudopositronic brain churning through the available data, and when a solution didn't become apparently available something else was added to the list:

 - **Compromise while decisions are considered**: Orbit current location whithin maximum radio range to effectively expand communications range.

And there were problems with this decision, like how small the range still was in the grand scheme of things, but when Pink_Unit thought of them they automatically triggered the common_sense daemons. The issues were much too obvious, and the solution was statedly a stopgap one, knowingly unideal. Thus, these issues weren't committed to the field report.

Pink_Unit, or Punk, stood still for a moment longer with it's sensors mainly focused on the moon: It was almost spotless here, compared to what its archives portrayed the Equestrian moon as. It also continued to omit anomalous signals.

Then the heat it emitted started to fade, now that it's boot was complete and several systems had grossly reduced workloads, so Punk left one of it's circle plates in the spot for any visitor that could decide to come and jumped off the ledge to start orbiting.
