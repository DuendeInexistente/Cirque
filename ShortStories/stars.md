# In a lighthouse...

Wind roared around the lighthouse. It always did at this height, but some days the unicorn mare just couldn't ignore the sound still. A lifetime of practice at it wasn't enough, maybe. Or maybe she was just slow.

Or maybe the wind was a constant, unrelenting reminder of what'd happen if she failed, if she fell asleep from boredom or just plain forgot to keep the magical fire alighted or to turn the focusing mirrors, of what'd happen if a ship hit their rocky shoals, the amount of spurn the family would get; and with righteous reason, then, if she was lazy or dumb enough to fail at what really were simple tasks.

Clacking on the well tiled floor, "Lady Fireclay."

She turned around from the brickwork window in front of her with a start, her hairs standing on end and not only because of the faint static in the air that had come with her family's guest. Yellow had a way to startle her sometimes.

The small, edgy Duda was coated in a mix of rusted metal that the family always tried desperately to keep at bay, on four detached legs with their bottom tips angled inwards like a scorption's. At some point it had floated instead, but now it walked as a result of 'Non-interrelative levitation systems growing damaged beyond practical usability' and would skulk around, 'collecting data' for whatever was that it did so, it's walking always slightly off and slightly disjointed and, in truth, everyone was convinced that yellow was slowly going insane. It wasn't any particular action, just the undergoing offness of someone you've known your entire life changing in subtle but unnerving ways that words could explain but not convey the importance of.

 "Lord yellow." She said out of compromise, expecting the answer.

 "This unit does not recognize nor need titles, but is honoured." Said lord yellow like it had to every member of her family for the last three generations. "Have you found news regarding Citizen Lettuce Leaf."

 "No." She said truthfully. Over a century now and still they had not heard anything: It induced a running, unstated but nonetheless *increasing* panic in the family to realize that if Citizen had ever been real, it was long since dead now. "I haven't."

And no one knew what would lord yellow do when it found out, or was forced to acknowledge, this fact.

And then lord yellow did something that, to Fireclay's knowledge, it had never done:

 "Are you sure." it questioned her. Or asked, Fire didn't know, because yellow always spoke plainly and, if it ever took offence in something, it was a small and secret sort of offence that to lords and ladies was much more scary than any bout of revenge. "Have you sought answers from locally lodged travellers."

 "Yes." She lied with the expertise that being nobility -even an overall minor one, subservant to the actual Lady of the city- gave her. But in reality, why ask? Why seek answers that in a hundred years had yet to come? It was an exercise in futility, it was.

 "Are you sure." At times yellow seemed to find it fit to draw a face on his circle plate, but not now. Now, it stared at her from the depths of it's own systems and machinations plain and unreadable.

 "Yes, lord yellow. Have you ever lied to you?" The heat from the pyre seemed so much hotter than usual tonight, blasting her like a furnace.

 "Is that a captious question."

Lady Fireclay almost twitched, almost allowed a second of hesitation to wonder if this was a question or captious on it's own, but a lifetime of seeing her friend and confidante grow insane had taught her not to:

 "No, lord yellow." She said without a pause in spite of the heat, turning the lighthouse's focal mirrors on their pivots. "It's not."

Yellow looked at -she supposed- her horn and then at the mirrors, and started climber the brickwork up to the pyre. "Allow me to assist."

 "There is no need--"

Yellow climbed the brickwork, it's legs awkward but somehow still precise and sharp, and helped her push with was -even for people used to it- a surprising amount of strength for such a little thing, the flame licking it's metal that somehow did not redden from it. "The mirrors have been aligned at the appropriate angle. Lady's Firework adherence to schedule remains steadfast."

And in spite of all Firework couldn't help smiling, because it was the exact same compliment, verbatim, that yellow had offered ever since she was a filly still learning the spells that kept the lighthouse's magical flame alive. Yellow never told her this when there was someone else around, just in their private moments. "Thankee, lord yellow."

 "This unit does not recognize nor require titles, but it is honoured." Yellow hopped down to the tiled floor, "Does the assistance have value equivalent to a hug." It stated-or-maybe-asked.

Fireclay blinked a few times, surprised by this, before answering. "Yellow, you're red-- You're too hot."

And yellow also paused at this, then said. "This unit is aware of it's temperature." It paused for a split second, then turned around to walk out of the room, it's leg rods starting to sparkle. "This unit will now continue readying to assist with the bug season."

 "Yellow, I can still hug you later." Rushed to say Fireclay, still surprised by how off yellow was being today. "If you really wanted it."

Yellow paused, and suddenly draw a simple face on it's circle plate.

 "This unit trusts Lady Fireclay to adhere to her schedule" It said, then walked out of the room. It's legs clack-clack-clacked against the stairs on it's way down.

And after a moment Fireclay turned around, and continued to stand watch over the city below.

# ...somewhere high...

An exact -Equestrian- year after it had last done so, pink_unit shook into motion. Power that usually cycled only to prevent damage of it's systems started galloping through it's copper veins like a stampede of horses and, even in the low-oxygen atmosphere, producing about as much heat in the process of booting up from hibernation.

In it's crystaline pseudopositronic brain data flowed into motion as the complex-enough class intelligence that resided started processing a year's worth of collected data. Wind speed, words heard idly by it's wandering pieces, air density to calculate height, shifting of star maps to calculate trajectory, the prayers of visitors, it all flowed and was rearranged in arbitrary combinations to try finding coinciding facts at insane speeds that true intelligence wouldn't have allowed. 

This happened in the space of almost an hour, only four of Pink_unit's pieces there with it, the two pieces of it's circle plates and two largest rays. Below on the back of the city, it's four smaller rays floated with semi-independant complex-enough intelligences seeking information, so Pink_Unit recalled them: As every time, protocol required that the wandering pieces did not stop their information seeking unless absolutely necessary. As every time, Pink_Unit's hardware simply *wasn't enough* to reprocess a year's worth of information in a reasonable timeframe without all of it's pieces -each with it's own brain simile- gathered together.

Pink_Unit was incapable of feeling frustration about protocol mismatching it's hardware specifications.

Technically all this information had been processed by the non-intelligence that composed Pink_Unit during hibernation, but protocol required self-optimization of procedures and Pink_Unit had found the non-intelligence to be insufficient for proper analysis: It simply wasn't as good at the arbitrary information-matching that was required for expanding separate facts into a larger awareness of the world, or at properly tagging important information.

Or, if those made of meat had wanted
