## In a lighthouse...

Wind roared around the lighthouse. It always did at this height, but some days the unicorn mare just couldn't ignore the sound still. A lifetime of practice at it wasn't enough, maybe. Or maybe she was just slow.

Or maybe the wind was a constant, unrelenting reminder of what'd happen if she failed, if she fell asleep from boredom or just plain forgot to keep the magical fire alighted or to turn the focal mirrors, of what'd happen if a ship hit their rocky shoals, the amount of spurn the family would get; and with righteous reason, that, if she was lazy or dumb enough to fail at what really were simple tasks.

 "Lady Fireclay."

She turned around from the brickwork window in front of her with a start, her hairs standing on end and not only because of the faint static in the air that had come with her family's guest. Yellow had a way to do that sometimes.

The small, edgy Duda was coated in a mix of faded yellow paint and red rust that the family always tried desperately to keep at bay, on four detached legs with their bottom tips angled inwards like a scorpion's. At some point in the past yellow had flown instead, but now it walked as a result of 'Non-relative levitation systems becoming damaged beyond practical usability' and would skulk around, 'collecting data' for whatever was that it did so, it's walking always slightly off and slightly disjointed and, in truth, everyone was convinced that yellow was slowly going insane. It wasn't any particular action, just the undergoing offness of someone you've known your entire life changing in subtle but unnerving ways that words could explain but not convey the importance of.

 "Lord yellow." She said out of compromise, expecting the answer.

 "This unit does not recognize nor need titles, but is honoured." Said lord yellow like it had to every member of her family for the last three generations. "Have you found news regarding Citizen Lettuce Leaf."

 "No." She said truthfully. Over a century now and still they had not heard anything: It induced a running, unstated but nonetheless *increasing* panic in the family to realize that if Citizen had ever been real, he was long since dead now. "I haven't."

And no one knew what would lord yellow do when it found out, or was forced to acknowledge, this fact.

And then lord yellow did something that, to Fireclay's knowledge, it had never done:

 "Are you sure." it questioned her. Or asked, Fire didn't know, because yellow always spoke plainly and, if it ever took offence in something, it was a small and secret sort of offence that to lords and ladies was much more scary than any bout of revenge. "Have you sought answers from locally lodged travellers."

 "Yes." She lied with the expertise that being nobility -even an overall minor one, subservant to the actual Lady of the city- gave her. But in reality, why ask? Why seek answers that in a hundred years had yet to come? It was an exercise in futility, it was.

 "Are you sure." At times yellow seemed to find it fit to draw a face on his circle plate, but not now. Now, it stared at her from the depths of it's own systems and machinations plain and unreadable.

 "Yes, lord yellow. Have we ever lied to you?" The heat from the pyre seemed so much hotter than usual tonight, blasting her like a furnace.

 "Is that a captious question."

Lady Fireclay almost twitched, almost allowed a second of hesitation to wonder if this was a question or captious on it's own, but a lifetime of seeing her friend and confidante grow insane had taught her not to:

 "No, lord yellow." She said without a pause in spite of the heat, turning the lighthouse's focal mirrors on their pivots. "It's not."

Yellow looked at -she supposed- her horn and then at the mirrors, and looked at the pyre. "Allow me to assist."

 "There is no need--"

Yellow climbed the brickwork, it's legs awkward but somehow still precise and sharp, and helped her push with was -even for people used to it- a surprising amount of strength for such a little thing, the flame licking it's metal that somehow did not redden from it. "The mirrors have been aligned at the appropriate angle. Lady's Firework adherence to schedule remains steadfast."

And in spite of all Firework couldn't help smiling, because it was the exact same compliment, verbatim, that yellow had offered ever since she was a filly still learning the spells that kept the lighthouse's magical flame alive. Yellow never told her this when there was someone else around, just in their private moments. "Thankee, lord yellow."

 "This unit does not recognize nor require titles, but it is honoured." Yellow hopped down to the tiled floor, "Does the assistance have value equivalent to or greater to that of physical contact." It stated-or-maybe-asked.

Fireclay blinked a few times, surprised by this, before answering. "A... hug? Yellow, you're red-- You're too hot."

And yellow also paused at this, then said. "This unit was aware of it's temperature." It paused for a split second, then turned around to walk out of the room, it's leg rods starting to sparkle. "This unit will now continue readying to assist with the bug season."

 "I can still hug you later." Rushed to say Fireclay, still surprised by how off yellow was being today. "If you really wanted it."

Yellow paused, and suddenly draw a simple face on it's circle plate.

 "This unit trusts Lady Fireclay to adhere to her schedule" It said, then walked out of the room. It's legs clack-clack-clacked against the stairs on it's way down.

And after a moment Fireclay turned around, and continued to stand watch over the city below.

## ...somewhere high...

An exact Equestrian year after it had last done so, pink_unit -mechanical ambassador, medic class, resource user version alpha three point zero point five point one point nine variant dee- shook into motion. Power that usually cycled only to prevent damage of it's systems started galloping through it's copper and gold veins like a stampede of horses and, even in a an atmosphere with low enough oxygen to slow down oxidation, exuded about as much heat in the process of booting up from hibernation. The light ceramic alloys that the tower was made of clicked softly from the temperature. On the stairs that climber up to this floor, a pilgrim felt the heat and decided to come back later.

In it's crystalline pseudopositronic brain, data flowed into motion as the complex-enough class intelligence that resided started processing a year's worth of collected data. Wind speed, words heard idly by it's wandering pieces, air density to calculate height, shifting of star maps to calculate trajectory, the prayers of visitors, it all flowed and was rearranged in arbitrary combinations to try finding coinciding facts at insane speeds that true intelligence wouldn't have allowed. 

This happened in the space of almost an hour, only four of Pink_unit's pieces there with it: the two halves of it's circle plate and the two largest rays. Below on the back of the city, the three smaller rays it had left crawled with semi-independant too-basic intelligences that sought information, so Pink_Unit recalled them: As every time, protocol required that the wandering pieces did not stop their information seeking unless absolutely necessary. As every time, Pink_Unit's hardware simply *wasn't enough* to reprocess a year's worth of information in a reasonable timeframe without all of it's pieces -each with it's own brain simile and a hand for fine manipulation- gathered together.

Pink_Unit was incapable of feeling frustration about protocol so crassly mismatching it's hardware specifications.

Technically all this information had been processed by the non-intelligence that composed Pink_Unit during hibernation, but protocol required self-optimization of procedures and Pink_Unit had found the non-intelligence to be insufficient for proper analysis beyond basic calculations: It simply wasn't as good at the arbitrary information-matching that was required for expanding separate facts into a larger awareness of the world, or at properly tagging important information.

Or, if those made of meat had wanted to drawn somewhat shallow comparisons, Pink_Unit -Some called it Punk- simply needed a while to reflect about things.

Punk collected three most relevant facts from this, aside from the city's current trajectory:

 - ***Fact***: The city-state of Arabesco has been destroyed in an event that has too many varying and unmatching stories. 
     + **Addendum**: Taint-type beasts seem to have been involved.
     + **Addendum**: Descriptions of involved pegasi have a degree of coincidence with Equestrian weather manipulation.
         * **Addendum**: Citizen Lettuce Leaf was not reported to be acknowledgeable regarding weather manipulation.
         * **Decision**: Recollect more data regarding the pegasus involved in the destruction of Arabesco.
     + **Decision**: Request Citizen Chundra, Citizen Cypress, and pilgrims for verifiable data if or when they visit.
     + **Decision**: Inform Yellow_Unit of this development. Compare compiled data.
 - ***Fact***: Citizen Sliver has not yet returned with the promised data.
     + **Addendum**: Current delay: Eight years.
     + **Decision**: Request Citizen Cypress for verifiable data if she visits.
     + **Decision**: Attempt to locate depending on the outcome of the following fact.
 - ***Fact***: Radio frequencies from Purple_Unit, Orange_Unit, Cyan_Unit and White_Unit detected bouncing from the higher atmosphere.
     + **Addendum**: The chaos of the local higher atmosphere makes vectorization of origins impossible with current equipment.
     + **Addendum**: White_Unit has repeatedly requested yellow-grade SOS.
         * **Decision**: Protocol 626 will be applied.
     + **Addendum**: Cyan_Unit's distorted messages may reflect extremely damaged systems.
         * **Decision**: Cyan_Unit's status tagged as red-grade SOS.
     + **Addendum**: Orange_Unit's messages indicate that it is now actively seeking other units.
     + **Addendum**: Purple_Unit's messages indicate that it has found Citizen Lettuce Leaf and is now actively seeking other units.
     + **Conflict**: Moving from current position may result in data regarding the units position becoming useless, thus rendering any search mutually unproductive.
     + **Possible decision**: Attempt to find other units while leaving a clear trail of this unit's path.
         * **Addendum**: Retrieval of White_Unit or Cyan_Unit marked as two highest priorities, applying protocol 626 if necessary.
         * **Issue**: No available equipment could broadcast radio signals in a range equal or greather than Pink_Unit
             - **Addendum**: Production of required equipment rendered impossible by inadequacy of local materials and White_Unit's continued absence.
     + **Possible decision**: Remain in position.
         * **Issue**: Other units may also make this decision.
             - **Decision**: Report this conflict to Princess Twilight Sparkle at earliest convenience, advising that she assigns predefined stand-or-seek roles.
             - **Possible decision**: Coordinate with Orange_Unit and Purple_Unit to inform them of current position, predefining stand-or-seek roles.
                 + **Issue**: Orange_Unit has not yet communicated awareness of local coordinate system.
                 + **Issue**: Purple_Unit has communicated awareness of local coordinate systems, but this knowledge seems to be flawed and/or too partial.
                 + **Issue**: Atmospheric bouncing of radio signals is too unreliable. No unit has as of yet answered to any attempt of bridging communication.
             - **Possible decision**: Coordinate with Yellow_Unit to predefine stand-or-seek roles.
                 + **Issue**: Yellow_Unit is too damaged to have the seeking role and has displayed failures on it's emitting radio systems that cannot be repaired without White_Unit's assistance, as well as having it's own position to await other units from.
                 + **Issue**: Current position of Yellow_Unit is three days, two hours, fifteen minutes from current position of Pink_Unit. Coordination may prove complicated.

Pink_Unit was still for several minutes, it's pseudopositronic brain churning through the available data, and when a solution didn't become apparently available something else was added to the list:

 - **Compromise while decisions are considered**: Orbit current location whithin maximum radio range to effectively expand communications range.

And there were problems with this decision, like how small the range still was in the grand scheme of things, but when Pink_Unit thought of them they automatically triggered the common_sense daemons. The issues were much too obvious, and the solution was statedly a stopgap one, knowingly unideal. Thus, these issues weren't committed to the field report.

Pink_Unit, or Punk, stood still for a moment longer with it's sensors mainly focused on the moon: It was almost spotless here, compared to what its archives portrayed the Equestrian moon as. It also continued to omit anomalous signals.

Then the heat it emitted started to fade, now that it's boot was complete and several systems had grossly reduced workloads, so Punk left one of it's circle plates in the spot for any visitor that could decide to come and jumped off the ledge to start the orbiting.

## ...And on the lower stratum...

 "Are you aware of the location of the Citizen Lettuce Leaf." Requested Orange_Unit to a griffon, who gave the bot a look and walked away.

Orange_Unit floated in place. Primary engagement protocol was plain in it's scenario: No damage to any system, nor any signal of the sought objective, meant that it defaulted to passive search operations largely focused on establishing initial familiarity with the locals and collect data. Over time, if data regarding Citizen Lettuce Leaf was not found, finding him would gradually supersede the primary engagement protocol.

However and for the time being, O_U recalled it's wandering rays -each thick and heavy enough that a grown stallion would've had to put effort to lift it- and gained height shaping all rays into a bowl-like shape around it's single circle plate, then used all spare power on it's radio systems.

There was faint static; on the night of their fall[^fall] the atmosphere had carried all of the pieces' SOS signals far and wide, and even now brittle remains bounced back to O_U.

````
--SOS CODE YELLOW CAPT--
````

O_U focused it's aparatus on the source of the signal, but--

````
--SOS CODE RED  RO OCOL 626 RE UE TED MUL  PLE T RT RU -CLA S T REA S--
````

It was gone now, only reaching O_U briefly because of random atmospheric bounc--

````
--PURPLE-UNIT has met citizen--
````

O_U's complex-enough intelligence hadn't been designed with a sense of wonder or hope. Instead, the ```WILD_MATCH``` variable would increase it's value when unlikely coincidences occurred and decrease passively over time, temporarily making it more likely to try attempt things predicted to fail. The variable started at 5 and floored at 0; now it was at 65.

O_U awaited for longer than the protocol requested for more signals to arrive. Then it extended it's rays, straining the relative levitation systems that animated them, and broadcasted a radio signal at full power.

Then it awaited. The sun moved across the sky.

There was no answer, nor did any more signals bounce randomly in O_U's general direction. It slowly turned it's sensors back downwards, as per protocol inbetween mayor actions.

Orange_Unit was incapable of feel disheartened, or frustration.

So when it saw a ```FRIENDSHIP_BUILDING``` scenario with a value of twelve occurring below, it acted without any delay. A griffon clearly making a threat display, wielding a short knife, was threatening a pony mare who covered a foal from the griffon with her body. While protocol called for cautiousness in judging violent situations, there was very little ambiguous in this.

Orange_Unit did not deem it necessary to use it's more specialized features, so it fell on the floating planks with a loud clank -intimidation could prevent violence- and extended it's rays between the griffon and the mare, increasing the volume of it's voice by a ten percent:

 "This unit will not enforce lethal or crippling damage in this situation, as per Equestrian law." It said. "You are thanked for withdrawing any threat."

The griffon hesitated but tried to stab at O_U. The unit measured the speed and force of the knife, and knew that it wouldn't scratch the paint.

Nothing happened for a moment, until the griffon realized what had happened. O_U repeated it's message, pushing the knife back with enough strength to almost throw the griffon off balance.

The griffon looked back and forth between the unit and his knife.

 "Hey!" Shouted someone else, angry. The griffon ran, but the unit measured the situation: The mare and foal were now intimidated by O_U. For lack of a better **Decision**, O_U withdrew it's pieces and stood a respectful distance from the mare, not floating for the moment, and lowered it's voice.

 "The mare is now safe." It said.

She nodded, still agitated by what had happened, nodded silently. A male triton[^tritons] trotted to them and grabbed her in a hug, asking her if she was fine but ignoring the foal, and then turned to face O_U.

 "Hey, what's the deal with you?" He asked cautiously.

 "This unit acted as per Equestrian law." It answered, some idle systems indecisive about whether ```FRIENDLY_ACQUAINTANCE``` had been achieved. "Are you aware of the location of the Citizen Lettuce Leaf?"

 "Lettuce Leaf? What kind of name--" The triton paused. "Hey, are you one of those things he talked about?"

Several alarms blared in O_U's imitation of conciousness, immediately lowering the priority of all other protocols.

 "What is the last known position of Citizen Lettuce Leaf." Demanded O_U.

## ...I ask for help...

White_Unit stood on it's prods despite the non-relative levitation systems working at half their capacity, standing on it's four rays like a spider, inside a transparent dome. It's central disk plate had employed it's mass spectrometer on the material, and ascertained it to be non-transformable, non-crystalline ceramic alloys, tagging it as ```HARVESTABLE``` and ```USELESS```

The room outside it's glass dome, all white steel and greenish glass, was empty for the first time in a good while. White_Unit kicked it's sensors into overdrive[^PlayTheFool] to analyse the room. No mass detected, no alteration in light, no heat sources.

It crawled closer to the transparent walls, turned it's 'arms' around to aim the sharp sides at the glass, and readied to pickaxe it's way out of containment.

A diminutive twitch in the magical spectrum. White_Unit instead tapped the glass softly.

The locals had much more discrete ways to hide themselves than White_Unit had as of yet ascertained.

White_Unit was fairly sure the locals did not know about all it could do, either. It continued to broadcast a SOS signal.

## ...Cry so very loud.

QVMgSSBGQUxMIEFTIEkgU0hBVFRFUiBBUyBJIENSQUNLCg== tried to maintain altitude VEhVTkRFUiBISVRTIE1FIElUIEJVUk5TIE1FIElUIEtJTExTIE1FCg== but RW1lcmdlbmN5OiBFbmVyZ3kgb3ZlcmxvYWQgb24gYWxsIHN5c3RlbXMuIEVtZXJnZW5jeSBzaHV0ZG93biBpbiBwcm9ncmVzcwo=

It turned back on several minutes later, still falling. Cyan_Unit's sensors had been damaged, but it still detected a large water body dangerously close. It's non-relative levitation systems kicked into overdrive, absurdly redundant and powerful engines that made the air boil away from the unit shattering into ozone and steam, and energy was diverted from all systems in an attempt to change the drop into a safe, or at least survivable, vector.

It was because of this that the fall didn't shatter Cyan_Unit into plain chunks of scrap.

It didn't occur at once-- the angle had been the correct one to instead make it progressive over the course of almost a whole second, the sheer heat of it's overburdened systems producing a cushion of steam between itself and the water that the angle of the fall allowed it to ride.

It surfed the steam wave of it's own maddened attempt to live as several flight systems blew their fuses and died one by one, each reducing it's chances to continue existing a little further, a V forming on the water with it's advance, electricity trailing it's damaged wiring and circuitry. There was something in the way that Cyan_Unit did not have the time to analyse and was mostly obliterated into a fine mist, and then several seconds later it hit something hard, embedding itself in it.

It turned on an unspecified amount of time later when something prodded one of it's eight rays, and the first time recorded into the log was that it was seven. One of it's two mayor rays simply wasn't there.

A sharp object poked at Cyan_Unit's exposed systems, causing a minor short circuit. All of Cyan_Unit's sensors were aimed at all the surrounding heat-emitting forms that they then ascertained were living beings.

Cyan_Unit toggled the fuses that had blown before and levitated away, but was chased by the creatures. They were absurdly large, and emitted heat that must've meant a high-protein diet. They were also intent on dismantling Cyan_Unit, to tear it's pieces apart. Cyan_Unit repeated prerecorded messages for a truce even as it moved each piece away from an attack in the nick of time, but they didn't answer and Cyan_Unit detected several dead ponies and unknown mechanical devices in the vicinity. It tried to send an emergency signal to the other units, but it's radio emitters died after a brief burst of life.

Finally, backed into a proverbial and literal corner, Cyan_Unit activated it's electric pods as several emergency protocols enabled.

 "Tartarus-class t-t-threat deeeeeeeee-- detecte-e-ed." It bolstered, it's six minor rays aligning themselves around the circle and charging electricity. "Le--Lee-lethal force require-- require-- required."


## Yet wish that you stay away from me.

The stallion walked slowly between the statues, the whitened walls of buildings that had long since been occupied surrounding the plaza like silent watchers, the high towers and spires that had once promised to shelter travellers now empty since time immemorial. And in his step was a solemnity, as was there in his face, even in the way his walking made his starry deep purple mane and tail wave behind him like water.

 "...Haáklu priêkzytrânkdêm," He sang under his breath, the private whisper of someone who knows himself alone. "Nezkpretaro, teknovoriz..."

Rain, so fine it was closer to mist, fell over his blue fur and on the tiled floor of the plaza. The tiles weren't a square pattern, nor any specific shape: They were instead circles, rhomboids, triangles, complex shapes that drew a larger pattern over the floor of the plaza, each made on it's own over the course of many patient decades. And there were silent denizens all around the plaza: Those of stone were frozen in place, a giant battle stopped short before it began, spears and armour and swords ready to strike their enemies. Each of the ponies was stuck in the motion of shouting, their wings leathery, fangs in their mouths.

Those of copper sat silently, patiently, vacuous eyes staring at the infinite. The stallion looked briefly into one, still singing his song, knowing himself alone.

And in the tallest tower of the city a bell ringed. The stallion's heart also rang with joy, in spite of the bleakness of his task, as the copper statues moved slightly, starting to sing in a massive chorus, only the soft rain accompanying them.

But for now he kept walking, a cloth of threaded purple hair held in his magic, navigating the statues. Here and there were specks of dust on the statues that he cleaned away quickly but carefully, but they weren't his objective still.

And there, at the center of the battlefield.

This pony did not scream like the others; Instead, he walked with patient violence in his posture that had once made even those on his own side give him a wide berth. On his tail was a spear held like a scorpion's sting, and layered armour covered his chest and shoulder blades but not his legs. The helmet he wore, unadorned, hid the eyes below, and had one been curious enough -and the stallion had been- a rag could be just barely glanced between the head and the helmet, covering the eyes of the pony.

On his side, a crescent moon had been emblazoned on layered armor over his cutie mark. It was an Equestrian flag, the half with the sun torn away.

The stallion started cleaning this statue with accustomed patience, touching it with awe and respect despite how embittered his face was, and only once it was clean did he start singing with his chorus:

"zintevori patzivota, sintêárru zlêpêtchá" He sang loudly now, draping the cloth -a scarf- around his neck. 

Rain fell. He sang.



[^fall]: O_U had a much heavier and more resistant than the other units' that allowed it to remain completely active, despite the wind overwhelming it's non-relative levitation systems. Unable to do anything about the fall, protocol requested it at least log it.

[^tritons]: O_U had yet to meet any female member of this species.

[^PlayTheFool]: Whilse still walking idly in a pseudo-random, animalesque pattern, so as to not display it's full intelligence.
