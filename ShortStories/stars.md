Wind roared around the lighthouse. It always did at this height, but some days the unicorn mare just couldn't ignore the sound still. A lifetime of practice at it wasn't enough, maybe. Or maybe she was just slow.

Or maybe the wind was a constant, unrelenting reminder of what'd happen if she failed, if she fell asleep from boredom or just plain forgot to keep the magical fire alighted or to turn the focusing mirrors, of what'd happen if a ship hit their rocky shoals, the amount of spurn the family would get; and with righteous reason, then, if she was lazy or dumb enough to fail at what really were simple tasks.

Clacking on the well tiled floor, "Lady Fireclay."

She turned around from the brickwork window in front of her with a start, her hairs standing on end and not only because of the faint static in the air that had come with her family's guest. Yellow had a way to startle her sometimes.

The small, edgy Duda was coated in a mix of rusted metal that the family always tried desperately to keep at bay, on four detached legs with their bottom tips angled inwards like a scorption's. At some point it had floated instead, but now it walked as a result of 'Non-interrelative levitation systems growing damaged beyond practical usability' and would skulk around, 'collecting data' for whatever was that it did so, it's walking always slightly off and slightly disjointed and, in truth, everyone was convinced that yellow was slowly going insane. It wasn't any particular action, just the undergoing offness of someone you've known your entire life changing in subtle but unnerving ways that words could explain but not convey the importance of.

 "Lord yellow." She said out of compromise, expecting the answer.

 "This unit does not recognize nor need titles, but is honoured." Said lord yellow like it had to every member of her family for the last three generations. "Have you found news regarding Citizen Lettuce Leaf."

 "No." She said truthfully. Over a century now and still they had not heard anything: It induced a running, unstated but nonetheless *increasing* panic in the family to realize that if Citizen had ever been real, it was long since dead now. "I haven't."

And no one knew what would lord yellow do when it found out, or was forced to acknowledge, this fact.

And then lord yellow did something that, to Fireclay's knowledge, it had never done:

 "Are you sure." it questioned her. Or asked, Fire didn't know, because yellow always spoke plainly and, if it ever took offence in something, it was a small and secret sort of offence that to lords and ladies was much more scary than any bout of revenge. "Have you sought answers from locally lodged travellers."

 "Yes." She lied with the expertise that being nobility -even an overall minor one, subservant to the actual Lady of the city- gave her. But in reality, why ask? Why seek answers that in a hundred years had yet to come? It was an exercise in futility, it was.

 "Are you sure." At times yellow seemed to find it fit to draw a face on his circle plate, but not now. Now, it stared at her from the depths of it's own systems and machinations plain and unreadable.

 "Yes, lord yellow. Have you ever lied to you?" The heat from the pyre seemed so much hotter than usual tonight, blasting her like a furnace.

 "Is that a captious question."

Lady Fireclay almost twitched, almost allowed a second of hesitation to wonder if this was a question or captious on it's own, but a lifetime of seeing her friend and confidante grow insane had taught her not to:

 "No, lord yellow." She said without a pause in spite of the heat, turning the lighthouse's focal mirrors on their pivots. "It's not."

Yellow looked at -she supposed- her horn and then at the mirrors, and started climber the brickwork up to the pyre. "Allow me to assist."

 "There is no need--"

Yellow climbed the brickwork, it's legs awkward but somehow still precise and sharp, and helped her push with -even for people used to it- was a surprising amount of strength for such a little thing, the flame licking it's metal that somehow did not redden from it. "The mirrors have been aligned at the appropriate angle. Lady's Firework adherence to schedule remains steadfast."

And in spite of it all Firework couldn't help smiling, because it was the exact same compliment, verbatim, that yellow had offered ever since she was a filly still learning the spells that kept the lighthouse's magical flame alive. Yellow never told her this when there was someone else around, just in their private moments. "Thankee, lord yellow."

 "This unit does not recognize nor require titles, but it is honoured." Yellow hopped down to the tiled floor, "Does the assistance have value equivalent to a hug." It stated-and-maybe-asked.

Fireclay blinked a few times, surprised by this, before answering. "Yellow, you're red-- You're hot."

And yellow also paused at this, then said. "This unit is aware of it's temperature." It paused for a split second, then turned around to walk out of the room.
