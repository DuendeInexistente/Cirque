When you're rife with  
there's a single explanation
you're a cruel god's creation
trapp'd inside a brittle world...
And whichever way it sways now
we must be resilient
we won't let it break our spirits
as we sing our silly song,
'cause our voices are harmonizing
and life's nothing but improvizing,
so why don't y'all stop fretting
and just sing around with me...



 "You learned myths and how to forge metal. You learned about the world and how to use it. You *are* of stone and flint."
