I can tell you anything yet can't talk and know nothing at all.
(A book)

------------------

When you're rife with hesitation
there's a single explanation
you're a cruel god's creation
trapp'd inside a brittle world...
But whichever way it sways
now we must be resilient
we won't let it break our spirits
as we sing our silly song,
'cause our voices are harmonizing
and life's nothing but improvizing,
so why don't y'all stop fretting
and just sing around with me...

Twilight turned to her mother feeling a small pit in her stomach as she realized something else: Her birthday party was mostly occupied with family, with only two people who weren't, one of which she didn't actually know. And her one other friend was nowhere to be seen- she had to assume she simply hadn't had the time.

Part of her expected someone to gift her a cat. That cat would have kittens, and then she'd be a cat lady.

 "Hey, psst," Diane grabbed her suddenly with a hoof across her withers, making Velvet close her mouth confusedly, "I almost forgot."

 "About what?"

 Diane slid a small saucer to her sneakily.

 "What?"

 "Asked 'round the hood, used my rep."
