Twilight Sparkle was stepping out of the university when a younger unicorn saw her and, visibly glad, trotted across the boardwalk to try reaching her, his saddlebags swinging wildly, "Professor Coruscante! Wait!"

And she winced, just a little bit and with her face which wasn't his way, but *walked slower*, because she still couldn't bring herself to stopping. Not with a good brunch waiting for her.

 "Yes, Star Tracker?"

The stallion -more of a colt, truly- seemed ashamed to be addressed by name, but didn't let that stop him. "It's just that I still don't understand this line." He took a book from one of his bags and flipped quickly to a marked page, "See?"

 "Well, Cirs aren't known for being straightforward." Twilight took the book herself and turned it around to read the tight writing. "Ah. It's saying that alicorns are creatures molded by mythical forces, remember that we talked about those in class?" She gave back the book and recited, smiling, "'Consider, then, the existence of alicorns -did they exist- as holistic and bound to a force...'"

He nodded quickly. "But that's what I don't get, alicorns don't exist. And I thought this book was going to suggest, I don't know, imply that they're just an idea, but even this..."

 "They're the same as minotaur *ree-eid-les* or griffon *Gold Bones*. That's what makes them holistic-" If she addressed him by name the colt might have died of embarrassment so, enjoying the conversation more than she had expected, Twilight decided to be more formal, so she addressed him by clan "-, Dalagare, alicorns don't truly exist, yet they are a persistent part of pony mind of culture. They are holistic not just because they are a combination of the three races or because they are bound to an element of the world, but also because they Aah, need external forces to congeal three magics into a fourth, and Bee, are something we know to exist despite them not existing."

Star Tracker followed her while thinking about this for a while, giving her a chance to look at the scenery. Many members of the university often lamented the utter lack of decorations or even lights surrounding the boardwalk, but she understood why this was and approved of it. Nearby on the shallows, under the posts that supported the boardwalk, the curving sand beach was a pleasant, relaxing sight, slowly lowering until the water was just pure blue, and in the distance one could see the green of the archipelagos-and as she looked, a plane taking off under the bright moon. It was a vista that invited thoughtfulness.


 "Alicorns are part of ponykind's whole?" Tried Star Tracker. "It's not an act of faith as some claim it to be. We know alicorns exist in the same way I can tell when there's magic or you could find seeds, because the fact is integral to us."

 "It is an act of faith. Or at least, I see it as that. It's just one that is, maybe an emergent property," She laughed a little at the small joke, realizing a split second too late that she'd made a pig noise. "Holistic by itself?"

 "Thanks for the help, and hey, did you hear of that number minotaurs made up?"

 "The tsei-ro?"

 "A number representing nothing, can you believe it?"

 "Not yet, Dalagare. But I am waiting for them to reply my letter. I will publish their answer on the gazette if you're interested?"

Star Tracker and Twilight were reaching the borders of the university's grounds, entering the citadel that had spawned around the university. Originally it'd been made so far from the coast to provide the students silence and the right amount of isolation, but as people travels and money flows, business is given to follow.

It was still a quiet little town, however, which pleased her. The head of the university (A position she'd reach one day, just you wait) had imposed very strict sanctions when it came to noise, and curfews during the week.

Star Tracker was growing increasingly self conscious by the time they reached the first storefront, seeing himself obligated to keep the conversation going and wanting to say something stuck on his throat.

Another plane flew overhead, prompting them both to look up at it, and then at the still daymoon and the mare on it. It was said that each people (griffons, minotaurs, even breezies) saw their own species on it, even in photographs.

 "Did you ever see the soon, teacher?" He asked.

 "The sun? No, I was too young to remember." Was Star Tracker tried to create a moment? She wasn't sure- he had a famously corny streak. Nevertheless, math happened on her mind quickly. "This would be a crescent moon if we had it." But of course, they didn't, because nowadays the moon had to rush through its cycles to emulate day and night, and both daystars and nightstars blinked on and off weakly, barely visible even during the night.

 "I thought it w... Miss?"

Twilight turned to him and then to the spot he was looking at, curious. There were a few others on the boardwalk, even a siren, but it was obvious Tracker was not looking at any of them.

A large earth pony stood near a bakery, tall enough that (And part of Twilight wanted to test this) if she had stood on Star Tracker's back, then she *might* have been at eye level. Her deep purple coat was pristine, and her eyes, a light shade of yellow that still looked dirty somehow, were intent on the both of them.

No, not on *them*. Being looked at changed something, because then the mare, moving only slightly and lazily like a cat made of stone, shifted to stare directly at Twilight.

 "Is... Is that someone you know, Coruscante?" Tracker gulped, his horn sparking in preparation to do whatever it might need to do. "It's someone who knows you at least."

 "Let's not find out." Twilight pulled him by the horn (She was a teacher after all, and responsible for his well being) and walked away from the strange, oppressive mare.

-----------

 "Just staring?"

 "Yes, she didn't try to follow me." Twilight had said it to quench the mare's doubt, but found herself glancing back at the entrance just in case. "If she'd wanted any business with me she would've spoken, wouldn't she?"

 "Maybe it's an admirer." The discrete bar, never calm at this time of the day, burst with movement for a split second when the pink mare bounced more than walked to an incoming client. Twilight pecked at her brunch in the moment of peace, but soon enough the mare returned, smiling like she'd never gone away.

 "It wasn't a flattering look, no." Twilight shook her head.

 "What was it like?"

 "It was like, hm..." Twilight did her best to imitate the stone faced expression, finding it unexpectedly easy. "Like this."

 "Hmm..."

 "It's not an admirer, Diane."

 "*Hmmm...*"

 "Or a secret party planner."

 "He could be a *very* good one."

 "Looking at me like she'd club me to death?"

Diane did her best to mirror Twilight's expression, making her laugh- between the involuntary telephone game and Diane's bubbling personality, it wasn't particularly close to the mare's face.

 "Do I look like I have a crush on and or am planning a special party for you?" She asked, making a clear effort to keep the mean face on. It made her features tremble.

 "Aaah no, still no, but I wouldn't rule out the possibility either."

Diane's features *exploded* into a smile as soon as she let them, and she talked halfheartedly. "Have I ever told you that you're self important this time of the week, Twi?"

 "Miss Diane of the Rockadee, I am gorgeous in mind and body." Twilight smiled magnanimously, then that said, ate a mouthful of brunch in the most unladylike fashion she could.

Which, going by Diane's expression, was amusingly little. She opened her mouth for a retort, but a new client demanded her attention and she bounced off.

Twilight did, in fact, have a vague, distracted pride in her physique. Being an earth pony meant she felt obliged to standards, which included not a pretty rump -Not that it was necessary, *ThankYouVeryMuch*, she was aware it received a pleasant amount of looks from teachers and students alike- but to maintain level of fitness even if her scholarly life didn't demand it. To not do so would've been an affront to her heritage.

And here was Diane. A mare that could've been a ballerina if she'd wanted to, a famous one at that, but worked at a bar because she liked the conversation. Her fast movement belied the sheer, effortless grace of it.

It was enough to make anyone jealous, it was, no mater the race.

--------------

Being a polymath implied a certain status to uphold. Even when she'd been a student of the university (A status that she actually planned to return to relatively soon, if only partly, to get her next diploma) teachers and family had reminded her that, by starting out with topics as disparaging as folklore and materials science, she had to send a strong, visible message that she was indeed acknowledgeable about both topics and not spreading herself thin. For this reason, she had to be a prim and (Something that came more naturally to her) neat lady in public, else people wouldn't trust what she claimed to know, diplomas or no diplomas. Not until she amassed more success than she already had.

That stopped at home. The real home, not the rooms which she allowed formal guests into.

It wasn't just the books, most of which she was confident in being the legitimate owner of, piling on every available surface; those were expected and respected in a member of the academia. It wasn't the scorch marks from Spike's recent flu, or the pools of molten-and-solidified glass from when they attempted to reduce the fire risk during said flu with bubble helmets, or what Diane called Creative Disorder. It wasn't the books marked with food or hair or other, smaller books which might also be marked the same way. It was the book fort.

It hadn't been intentional. In his earlier years Spike had grown territorial and aggressively demanded his own boat by making a book fort and claiming all books its walls were made from his own. Twilight had given him his boat house -a small one for now- but the book fort had remained because when you have that volume of books, stairs and ladders become impractical. They use up space that could  be used by more books.

So it wasn't a fort. It was an aid to transit that shifted organically as her research and interests did, only kept away from her chemistry rooms and from positions where it might block doors. And she wasn't damaging the books either- the really delicate or unique ones had their own glass-covered shelves. *Or* in risk of collapse, because she knew a thing or two about construction.

So her library (an area that had slowly expanded to occupy a living room and dormitory until she surrounded an entire boat house to the books, and bought another at great expense) was, despite initial appearances, a rather sturdy and neat construction, as close to such a thing as one can get without nailing and tying the elements together. Books were piled from larger to smaller and only those that were fit for such a thing were used in the construction, the rest, piled on each other like bricks in such a way that one could remove them without risking collapse, and the bridges connecting the second level, well, she was proud of the bridges. It'd been a childhood dream come true when she figured out how to make those 

And any similarities to a castle were either purely coincidental or convergent design.

Spike wasn't there when she opened the door, nor was there any sign that he'd eaten in the kitchen- the pantry was untouched, as was his 'secret' gem stash, and he wasn't sick because the bathroom was perfectly clean.

Or was he just sleeping in? Twilight navigated the library because it was the shorter path to Spike's boat house, a single roomer with a small engine that he'd nevertheless been avid in calling his own, and noticed the engine had some soot on it. Had he gone to the archipelago? Strange, because it was cool and the little dragon was unusually strict when it came to keeping it clean and well tuned. He'd even accepted when she offered teaching him mechanics on the weekends.

 "Spike? Is anything wrong?" She called him, not opening the door yet but ready to.

 "Y-yeah! Just--" Something meaty fell with a thud, eliciting a cry from him. "Just let me--"

*Hold up*.

Spike acting like he'd been caught red handed, yet it was obvious he'd done nothing wrong, closed up in his room, where he'd gone with enough urgency as to even leave his engines dirty. Was what had fallen him, or someone else?

 "Nevermind me." She backed off quickly. "I've got to ah talk with parents, nevermind me."

-----------

It just so happened that she did have to talk with parents, an elderly couple who knocked her door worried about why was their colt avoiding them, and Twilight had to be very professional despite the recent awkwardness and tell them that while he looked just fine and his grades hadn't changed significantly, his friends would have better answers. Maybe a demanding marefriend, she ventured? Spike entered the kitchen while she was talking, hoping to a chair to get the good quartz and acting like nothing had happened.

Which was just ok. Twilight was good at pretend.

 "How was your day?" Asked Spike,then shoved a clawful of quartz into his mouth with exaggerated nonchalance. He was wearing the paperboy hat he liked wearing when he went to town, but nothing else, which seemed odd to Twilight given the situation.

 "Yours?" She asked automatically.

He shrugged and lifted his hands, cheeks puffed; 'Can't talk, mouth full.'

 "Well, this otter barged into the comparative mythologies class..." She took a seat at the table with him. "One of my students had some chowder in his pack, you see, and it wouldn't have been so bad if her kids hadn't followed her in." Spike gave her a questioning look. "With half a dozen plus their mom and the way people treats otters here? The class was a petting zoo after that, nothing I could do. I changed the topic to otter-related myths to teach them *something* they'd pay attention to after that happened."




I can tell you everything yet can't talk and know nothing at all.
