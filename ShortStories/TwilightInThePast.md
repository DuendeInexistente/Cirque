Twilight Sparkle was stepping out of the university when a younger unicorn stallion saw her and, visibly glad, trotted across the boardwalk to try reaching her, his saddlebags swinging wildly, "Professor Coruscante! Wait!"

And she winced, just a little bit and with her face which wasn't his way, but *walked slower*, because she still couldn't bring herself to stopping. Not with a good brunch waiting for her back home, or for what she expected from him.

 "Yes, Star Tracker?"

The stallion -more of a colt, truly- seemed ashamed to be addressed by name, but didn't let that stop him. "It's just that I still don't understand this line." He took a book from one of his bags and flipped quickly to a marked page, "See?"

 "Well, Cirs aren't known for being straightforward." Twilight took the book herself and turned it around to read the tight writing. "Ah. It's saying that alicorns are creatures molded by mythical forces, remember that we talked about those in class?" She lowered the book and recited, smiling widely, "'Consider, then, the existence of alicorns -did they exist- as holistic and bound to a force...'"

 "But that's what I don't get, alicorns don't exist." He nodded quickly. "And I thought this book was going to suggest, I don't know, imply that they're just an idea, but even this..."

 "Just like minotaur *ree-eid-les* or griffon *Glass Bones*. That's what makes them holistic-" If she addressed him by name the colt might have died of embarrassment so, enjoying the conversation more than she had expected, Twilight decided to be more formal. "-, Dalagare, alicorns don't truly exist, yet they are a persistent part of pony mind of culture. They are holistic not just because they are a combination of the three races or because they represent an element of the world, but also because they Ah, need external forces to congeal three magics into a fourth, and Bee, they are something we know to exist despite them not existing."

Star Tracker followed her while thinking about this for a while, giving her a chance to read some more before looking up from the book. Many members of the university often lamented the utter lack of decorations surrounding the boardwalk, but she understood why this was and approved of it. Nearby on the shallows the curving sand beach was a pleasant, relaxing sight, slowly lowering until the water was just pure blue, and in the distance one could see the green of the archipelagos-and as she looked, a plane taking off. It was a vista that invited thoughtfulness.

 "Alicorns are part of ponykind's whole?" Tried Star Tracker. "It's not an act of faith as some claim it to be. We know alicorns exist in the same way we know other worlds exist, despite the difficulty of proving so, because the fact is integral to us."

 "It is an act of faith. Or at least, I see it as that. It's just one that is, maybe an emergent property," She laughed a little at the small joke, realizing a split second too late that she'd made a pig noise. "Holistic by itself?"

 "Thanks, for the help, and hey, did you hear of that number minotaurs made up?"

 "Tsei-ro?"

 "A number representing nothing, can you believe it?"

 "Not yet, Dalagare. But I am waiting for them to reply my letter. I will publish their answer on the gazette if you're interested."

Another plane flew overhead. Star Tracker and Twilight were reaching the borders of the university's grounds, entering the citadel that had spawned around the university. Originally it'd been made so far from the coast to provide the students silence, but as people travels and money flows, business is given to follow.

It was still a quiet little town, however, which pleased her. The head of the university -Who she'd replace one day, just you wait- had imposed very strict sanctions when it came to noise and curfews during the week.

Star Tracker was growing increasingly self conscious by the time they reached the first storefront, seeing himself obligated to keep the conversation going and wanting to say something that Twilight was hoping he didn't. Age and rank kept them apart; A distance that, as she had confided to friends on occasion, she was *quite* comfortable with.
