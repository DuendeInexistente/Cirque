Wind roared around the lighthouse. It always did at this height, but some days the unicorn mare just couldn't ignore the sound still. A lifetime of practice at it wasn't enough, maybe. Or maybe she was just slow.

Or maybe the wind was a constant, unrelenting reminder of what'd happen if she failed, if she fell asleep from boredom or just plain forgot to keep the magical fire alighted or to turn the focusing mirrors, of what'd happen if a ship hit their rocky shoals, the amount of spurn the family would get; and with righteous reason, then, if she was lazy or dumb enough to fail at what really were simple tasks.

 "Lady Fireclay."

She turned around from the brickwork window in front of her with a start, her hairs standing on end and not only because of the faint static in the air that had come with her family's guest.

The small, edgy Duda was coated in a mix of rusted metal that the family always tried desperately to keep at bay, on four detached legs with their bottom tips angled inwards like a scorption's. At some point it had floated instead, but now it walked as a result of 'Non-interrelative levitation systems growing damaged beyond practical usability' and would skulk around, 'collecting data' for whatever was that it did so, it's walking always slightly off and slightly disjointed and, in truth, everyone was convinced that yellow was slowly going insane. It wasn't any particular action, just the undergoing offness of someone you've known your entire life changing in subtle but unnerving ways that words could explain but not convey the importance of.

Watching him walk was like seeing a stick figure come to life, in all the wrong ways.

 "Lord yellow." She said out of compromise.

 "This unit does not recognize nor need titles, but is honoured." Said lord yellow like it had to every member of her family for the last three generations. "Have you found news regarding Citizen Lettuce Leaf."

 "No." She said truthfully. Over a century now and still they had not heard anything: It induced a running, unstated but nonetheless *increasing* panic in the family to realize that if Citizen had ever been real, he was long since dead now. "I haven't."

And no one knew what would lord yellow do when it found out, or was forced to acknowledge, this fact.

And then lord yellow did something that, to Fireclay's knowledge, he had never done:

 "Are you sure." He questioned her. Or asked, Fire didn't know, because yellow always spoke plainly and, if it ever took offence in something, it was a small and secret sort of offence that, to lords and ladies, was much more scary than any bout of revenge. "Have you sought answers from locally alodged travelers."
