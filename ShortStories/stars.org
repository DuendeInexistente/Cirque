Wind roared around the lighthouse. It always did at this height, but some days the unicorn mare just couldn't ignore the sound still. A lifetime of practice at it wasn't enough, maybe. Or maybe she was just slow.

Or maybe the wind was a constant, unrelenting reminder of what'd happen if she failed, if she fell asleep from boredom or just plain forgot to keep the magical fire alighted or to turn the focusing mirrors, of what'd happen if a ship hit their rocky shoals, the amount of spurn the family would get; and with righteous reason, then, if she was lazy or dumb enough to fail at what really were simple tasks.

 "Lady Fireclay."

She turned around from the brickwork window in front of her with a start, her hairs standing on end and not only because of the faint static in the air that had come with her family's guest.

The small, edgy Duda coated in a mix of red rust and old yellow paint walked on four legs like a scorpion's, as a result of "Non-interrelative levitation systems growing damaged beyond practical usability.", and with the dismembered parts of it's body each moving on it's own part of the floating and methodical but slightly disjointed swirling and turning that it walked with. It was like watching a stick figure come to life, in all the wrong ways.

 "Lord yellow." She said out of compromise.
 "This unit does not recognize nor need titles, but is honoured." Said lord yellow like it had to every member of her family for the last three generations. "Have you found news regarding Citizen Lettuce Leaf."

 "No." She said truthfully. Over a century now and still they had not heard anything: It induced a running, unstated but nonetheless *increasing* panic in the family to realize that if Citizen had ever been real, he was probably long since dead now. "I haven't."

And no one knew what would lord yellow do when it found out, or was forced to acknowledge, this fact.





 -the room of the top room, in truth, was little more than windows with only the least possible amount of columns; Most lighthouses had no windows at all but her family had long since decided that, if a lot of their duty was to stay up there, they'd do it comfortably-
