Pledge soared the skies like a lowly comet, tailed by sparks and distorted air. Time and time again, as he glided the upstream produced by his own heat, people paused when they saw him and first in Landly, then in ships in the open sea, griffons had even attempted to reach him for purposes that he did not know nor care about.

Placidly casual wingbeats had left everyone behind, everyone save a pegasus that managed to match his speed effortlessly, but producing more heat thinned the air around him enough that the pegasus was forced to accept defeat and stop her chase with a sardonic smirk. A blacky, as his friends so long ago would’ve said: Just someone waiting to be charred by their righteous glory. Pledge had the feeling that pegasus wanted to fight him.

The insolence.

Now there was only open sea below him, interrupted here and there by whales and ships. Why were the whales flying so casually, knew they not the sharks? And why were the ships so crassly unguarded against that same danger? 

Also importantly, where had all those copper automatons and the fast, flightless birds come from? Pledge supposed the birds were intelligent, for they were spoken to, and that most [^duda] automatons were as well.

Although the sun shone strong and Pledge could’ve continued to fly on for weeks longer without a stop, after days of such observations Pledge glided down. The body was willing but the mind tired, and he decided that maybe attempting to talk and clear his questions would suffice for the time being.

It wasn’t cowardice as much as utilitarianism that made him chose the wounded ship, being repaired after a clash with pirates that were sinking as Pledge perched on the crow’s nest, for his observation. They would be less likely to trouble him while licking their wounds, although it was *dreadful* that he had to wait so long before a small automaton greeted him.

How curious, it was not much larger than a breezie and lacked all their inherent magic! Pledge felt tempted to question the automaton’s intellect[^brain] but decided against wounding its pride, for the way the creature crawled showed a great deal of pride indeed.




[^duda]:
Some specimens he’d seen moved in abhorrently mechanical fashions and were only spoken to in simple and clear words by other, more fluently speaking automatons. It stood to reason that these were no more than useful pets.

[^brain]:
It wasn’t racism, not necesarily: If asked, Pledge would’ve explained that he simple doubted much could be packed into such a small chasis.
