Pledge soared the skies like a lowly comet, tailed by sparks and distorted air. Time and time again, as he glided the upstream produced by his own heat, people paused when they saw him and first in Landly, then in ships in the open sea, griffons had even attempted to reach him for purposes that he did not know nor care about.

Placidly casual wingbeats had left everyone behind, everyone save a pegasus that managed to match his speed effortlessly, but producing more heat thinned the air around him enough to force her to accept defeat and stop her chase with a sardonic smirk. A coal, as his friends so long ago would’ve said: Just someone waiting to be charred by their righteous glory. Pledge had the feeling that pegasus wanted to fight him.

The insolence was soon forgotten.

Now there was only free, open sea below him, interrupted here and there by whales and ships. Why were the whales flying so casually, knew they not the sharks? And why were the ships so crassly unguarded against that same danger? 

Also importantly, where had all those copper automatons and the fast, flightless birds come from? Pledge supposed the birds were intelligent, for they were spoken to, and that most [^duda] automatons were as well.

Although the sun shone strong and Pledge could’ve continued to fly on for weeks longer without a stop, after a mere month of such observations Pledge glided down. The body was willing but the mind tired, and he decided that maybe attempting to talk and clear his questions would suffice for the time being.

It wasn’t cowardice as much as utilitarianism that made him chose the wounded ship, being repaired after a clash with pirates that were sinking as Pledge perched on the crow’s nest, for his observation. They would be less likely to trouble him while licking their wounds, although it was *dreadful* that he had to wait so long before a small automaton greeted him.

How curious, it was not much larger than a breezie and lacked all their inherent magic! Pledge felt tempted to question the automaton’s intellect[^brain] but decided against wounding its pride, for the way the creature crawled showed a great deal of pride indeed.

It spoke gibberish, even to trained ears such as Pledge’s. What manner of insolence was this? Did it even know how to speak the noble song of phoenix?

Hm.

Pledge supposed, in this case, he did not know it’s words either, and as such did not know that it was *not* equally noble. He patted the small automaton, signaling that he forgave the offense, and sought a larger and adult automaton, soon finding one that caught his eye: Tall, walking on two legs and with something like metallic wings on its back, it stood uncomfortably puzzled as to how to help the automatons who were dedicated to repair. Its face was an empty glass curve, but the sole light hovering in it surprised Pledge with its expressivity, so he sang something when the automaton noticed something.

 “Ah…” He spoke musically. “Give me a moment, I know your…” The automaton asked him to be patient with a gesture of his finger, and sang, “*Is… I, Is I correct*?”

It was the best Pledge had found so far, so he thanked the automaton’s effort dearly.

 “*Is…* Automata? *The word is… unknown to I?*”

Pledge explained that it meant the automaton was a constructed vessel for the soul that is purpose, which confused it further, but they continued to speak, discussing their travels. Pledge had noticed the direction the ship came from, and asked if the automata came from Landly as well.

 “*Yes, a temple,* Church of the rouse, *I… felt the need to widen my view again. I am, how do I…* Shinza?” it said questioningly.

Pledge sang that he didn’t know the word.

 “*Something like, distanced. The church brought me… solace, once, but could provide nurturing no more*.”

A cage, asked Pledge?

 “*Only for my… mind. I traveled once, and I seek to widen my view again, so that I may… unwound my mind.*”

The automaton sought greatness, then. Transcendence.

 “*Is a way of, yes, putting it. Do you have a destination, mister?*”

Something emerged from the water, like a pair of steel jaws surrounding the entire ship. Pledge’s wings flared furiously when he beat them, taking the winged automaton with him and escaping the jaws’ prison before they closed. It looked down speechless as Pledge continued to ascend to what felt like a safe distance, as the automaton cried about it’s kin trapped in the ship below.

Cables shot from the water, all aimed at Pledge, what manner of insult was this?

To think that mere steel could contain a phoenix?

He shone with a fury greater than that of this poor copy of a sun on the sky, turning the metal to vapor when it approached him.

 “Please, mister!” Cried the automaton in his grasp, reminding Pledge of his existence… and making him notice he had almost melted is arm into slag without noticing. “You saved me, but I can’t take such heat!”

This would be a problem. Pledge sang furiously, asking if it knew what was this attack, and if mere pirates knew such sciences now. Was the world not plunged to a dark age?

 “I don’t know, I’ve never seen something like this!” Another cable was shot, and the automaton cried in surprise when Pledge jerked to take the cable with his beak and tugged it suddenly, sending whatever had launched it for a spin.

  “I can hear them in my head, their chatter!” The automaton covered its glass face with a hand, “They… they are not pirates, but they’ve been tracking you all day! Someone said you are valuable research!”

Well, then.

Pledge let even more heat than before wrap his wings, and asked the automaton if it could relay a message to them. Some sort of radio in its body? It had mentioned being a messenger, after all.

 “I do not know what that is either, my kind can—”

Pledge interrupted the automaton with a mighty cry, not for it but to the pursuers. He sang his name and of his family, and even if his foes did not know the noble song, they knew fear.

Some coal needed a lesson.

[^duda]:
Some specimens he’d seen moved in abhorrently mechanical fashions and were only spoken to in simple and clear words by other, more fluently speaking automatons. It stood to reason that these were no more than useful pets.

[^brain]:
It wasn’t racism, not necesarily: If asked, Pledge would’ve explained that he simple doubted much could be packed into such a small frame, in the same way chicks need being fed and protected.
