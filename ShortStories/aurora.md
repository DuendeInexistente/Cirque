 "Breathe in and out, yes that's good, now I want a smile."

The foal smiled for Celestia.

 "Good, now say it with me... 'They say there's nothing pretty left, but we're here.'"
 
The foal echoed her words. He was dressed  with colorful feathers and held a harp on his hooves, and with every word from Celestia, he grew more confident.

 "Now let's go show these ponies something pretty."

She entered the stage followed by her troupe, all of them adorned and dusted and ready to make someone's night memorable. They all smiled because she was smiling, a family without blood that understood and shared her passion and love for beauty.

And then, behind the crowd that was awaiting their show, a magenta light grew in the sky. Everyone grew worried when her smile faded at first, erased by disbelief and surprise that made her breath grow uneven, and her ribs, light as paper and brittle like glass, felt like they were constraining her chest, making it impossible to breathe.

 "It can't be." She had to labor her breath until it was stable again, but still wheezed a laugh and smiled dumbly.

The crowd was about to look back, to search what she and her troupe were looking at, but she didn't care, not now that she had received such news.

 "I know I promised you another show." She said, not needing any gadgets for her voice to be heard by all, "But sometimes a song comes from the heart, one that you can't keep in!" She turned to the others and asked them for a song, a *special* song.

 "But we practiced--"

 "I know!" She laughed. "But what else could we do now?"

 "Go with the show?" Asked the harp foal, hopeful. "The one we prepared for?"

 "Where's the fun in that?" Celestia laughed and started singing, not giving them a chance to protest anymore.

 "Allegria,

 "I see a spark of life shinning!

 "Allegria,

 "Come la rabbia di amar,

 "Come un assalto di gioia!

She laughed, because she couldn't not.

Lucero felt rather than saw it, alone in one of the temples of the empty city with its stoney residents sitting around every corner. Something was breaching into his night sky... A familiar someone, who he left pass without any disturbance.

She was back? He walked to a window, its panes made of light blue glass, and looked at the aurora for a while. At first he smiled, but the more he thought about things, the more dejected his expression grew.

At last he walked away from the window, and returned to sculpting the stone walls.

-----

Water raged, and wind howled. This wasn't a natural occurrence.

She felt her chitin crack when the taint beast crashed into it, but grew it back to protect the tender insides and *bit* into the beast, letting her lower jaw come off and transforming it into a snake that dug itself into her foe tunneling through its flesh. She then  warped hoof into something sharper, and impaled the beast while it howled in pain.

After all was said and done she was left there, alone, in the calming sea, with the taint beast slain at her hooves. Its blood attempted to crawl into her, but whenever it did, holiness burned it away, and -barely noticed- her jaw crept back onto her face.

Then a pink glimmer caught her by surprise in the early dusk, making her look at the sky. The elevator was turned from glimmering grays of steel into sparkling pinks by the aurora that outshone sun and moon both, hiding the stars.

 "Ah." She nodded with her eyes lost, leaving her mouth open, and nearly mouthed something mutely, looking around, before talking aloud. "Her."

No one answered. No one ever answered.

Still with her mouth half open and staring into the infinite, she tapped the controls of her elevator, and it sank with her and the corpse.

-------------

An old mare, the corner of her mouth yellowed by years upon years of chain smoking, coughed her way out of the shower. What had made the water heater act up like that suddenly? She didn't know and frankly, didn't care, all that she wanted now was to cool down, because the jets of steaming water had caused something on her crotch she wasn't particularly ashamed of, but found impractical.

She willed her flesh to mend while searching a small tub, and by the time she walked down the ladder from her porch to the water to fill it, there weren't any signs that she'd been hurt. After this she decided to just spend a moment outside, sitting with her rump on the tub until her loins had quietened down, and summoned the most basic of things in life. A cigarette.

That's about when the aurora appeared on the night sky, bright pink, right over Landly. She looked at it for a while, and in the dark of early dusk lit only by her stick, her shape seemed to warp and twist. Old, but well trained gears in her head spun madly before she was able to remember the significance of such lights.

 "What is this now, gods?" She asked to no one in particular, "What are you playing at?"

Someone may have answered. She smoked the night away.

------------------

The moon approached.

Stallions and mares alike ran to their posts. Candles and torches were unlit one after the next as the moon’s silver glow rendered them unnecessary. Here, a foal climbed to the ceiling to watch the display, there a small mare and stallion, both too small to do their duty safely, watched from the back lines.

Here, a pegasus with long, flowing blue mane climbed out of a trapdoor in the ice, smiling widely. Some called him gran grin, because he rarely had any other expression. Someone called him from downstairs but he told them not to worry, that he’d be careful. His large wings, not made for swimming, were open at first and came out from under his cape, but as the moon approached the icy town and the wind picked up, he had to fold them to avoid being pushed away. Next came his mane, which he tied without stopping his walk. Snow dust battered his face and made his fever weaker, and he joined all others who reported for the front line. He’d taken care of some of them as foals and advised or mentored almost everyone, and as such, the greetings were warm and abundant.

His hindlegs and back held strong and firm, and his laugh and face were youthful in spite of his age, and many people would forget his real age, which didn’t particularly trouble him. They asked him if the wife was well and if the kids came strong, and he laughed and told them, yea, she looks like she’s about to burst, and that they still hadn’t decided on a name. ‘Grinlets’, suggested someone. Grin laughed.

Everyone walked into the large plaza where the moon was welcomed, some nervous and some laughing and some drunk. For some people the jitters never went away, and he did his best to laugh and smile and joke and help them forget how dangerous this was, that each time could be the last— for them and the world. The moon was only a few miles away now, and a bearded stallion whose name he forgot but whose face he remembered -an issue he’d always had, since his childhood so far away- made a bad joke that Gran answered to in kind.

They all readied , facing the same way, as the moon fell miles, meters closer to them; It’s sheer size belied the speed at which it fell, and even with the size of their town and task force, the plaza was *maybe* half the moon’s total diameter— an accomplishment belittled by their monumental task.

It didn’t mater. They’d be enough and without asking for anyone’s thanks, just like they never had. The honor of this was reward enough. 

------------------------

 Sparks watched the sky intently from her foyer, with her parents dinning nearby. She had been told that the house had once been part of a theater, so even if all the other kids said she *was* rich, no, they weren’t. Just lucky. And mom was crazy. 

She watched the sky intently, because if she caught *it* fast enough, then she’d cry out and make her parents look up, undoubtedly proving that it was real, thus proving she was right.

 “Honey, your food’s getting cold.” Said her mother. Sparks ignored her and kept watching.

Stars blinked on and off slowly around the Big Brother, who the adults told her was the colt in the moon but she always thought seemed more like a giant eye, staring and unsettling among all the pretty stars. And then…

One of the stars turned off completely. It shone green, seemed to fall, and disappeared, “Mom! Dad, look!”

 “What?” They looked up through the glass ceiling.

 “It’s gone! See? I told you the star of two was—”

 “It’s there.” Said her dad carefully, “Look at it, hun.”

Sparks looked back at it, because it was already back in place. *Drat*, and to think it had been gone for *hours* not too long ago, but her parents had been asleep.

 “What in Styx.” Said her dad.

 “Love, don’t cu— oh, fuck.”

Sparks looked up. The sky was purple, tinted by swirling lights that blotted out the stars and even colored the moon. She laughed at the pretty display, and once her parents came out of their shock, they laughed too.

 “What is it?” She asked, not taking her eyes from it. “Mom?”

 “I don’t know, hun.” She said breathlessly. “Love, get my oils please?”

 “Of course.” He trotted to the studio while Sparks’ mother prepared a canvas with her wings, dinner all but forgotten.

 “Didn’t you say a god was back?” Asked the mare with a shout.

 “Heard it’s a fire bird in Landly!” He shouted back. “Some moonlets in the docks were really excited about it!”

 “You said purple, though.”

 “You think this is related to that?”

 “Just throwing that out there.” She said distractedly, then sucked on a feather  to moisturize it properly. Most of her feathers had small amounts of paint on them, something she felt pride about.

 “I see— Spaaaarks!”

That wasn’t the kind of shout any kid wants to hear.

 “Come clean what your penguin did.”

 “But the lights!”

He paused for a moment at that, “Fine, but the moment they go away you clean this.”

 “Yes dad thanks dad!” She chirped. Smaller lights were joining the purple ones, orange and gold.

 “Is that coming anytime soon, love?” Asked her mother.

 “Where’s the emulsifier?”

 “Second shelf.”

 “Got it.” He said, heading back at a trot. “You… hun.”

 “Dad?”

 “Look at your flanks.”

Sparks did just that, not daring hope for what she saw.

A cutie mark, something like a compass; two vertical dark purple triangles, with two shorter horizontal magenta ones. Behind it was a wheel made of stone and flint -she knew it was stone and flint in the same way she knew she was a pony; It was just the way it was- that wasn’t quite large enough to encompass the tips of the vertical triangles.

 “I got a cutie mark!” She said, then asked, “I got a cutie mark?”

Her parents shared confused looks.

 “What were you doing?”

 “I dunno.” What if it was something *lame*?

 “We’ll figure it out.” Said her dad, walking to put a hoof on her withers. “Just you wait.”

 “Love.”

 “Oh!” Her dad took the tray from his flank quickly. “It’s not going away so soon, is it?”

 “No way to know.” She dipped several feathertips on oils to go *freestyle*, not bothering with sketches or preparation, biting a lip in concentration, her wings grazing against the canvas quietly as she combined colors quickly to get the right shades. First she made the moon, then she looked at her husband and daughter and gestured at them to come closer.

 “What do you think…” She caught Sparks as soon as she was in reach, pulling her closer with a hoof, “What do I call this?”

 “Aura!” Said Sparks.

 “Did you talk with miss Glass again?” Asked her dad, sitting near them.

 “No no, it’s stuff you can see around people and you can tell their heart of hearts and stuff.”

 “That’s not what he asked, hun.” Her mother used the blue feather to tint the very edges of the moon softly. “And that’s got no bite, does it?”

 “Maybe auror?” Asked the stallion, “Maybe you’ll even get to name it.”

Sparks felt odd, like there was a word stuck in her throat.

 “I am supposed to be more humbl—”

It took her an instant to realize she didn’t feel her mother’s warmth anymore.

 “Mom?”

There wasn’t anyone there, neither her mother or her father.

She was too surprised to be afraid yet, so much so that she sat there, alone, for several seconds before standing and looking for Yank.

Yank couldn’t do anything, she didn’t even know what made her want to find him now, but she looked for the old, cranky penguin nonetheless. Anyone else he pecked at, but still left her hug him if she didn’t squish too tight.

So she tapped him when she found him sleeping under the table. His wings, old and too weak to swim anymore, were moving in chase of ephemeral fish.

He honked at her, irritated by the rude interruption, and tried to go back to sleep.

Sparks sat in place. It was beginning to dawn on her that her parents were gone. She wanted to call them, and fell stupid and childish for it.

 “Dad?”

Yank moved, so she took and hugged him feeling her eyes moisten. Her mother’s oils had fallen on the floor and she’d not even noticed until now, even when her legs had paint from the bottles that’d broken, and not having realized it at the time made her upset- Maybe she could’ve caught the tray and prevented that.

Where had they gone?

She hadn’t fallen asleep.

Yank wasn’t in her arms anymore.

She tried not to squeak, took deep breaths that were each shakier than the last, and almost called Yank but didn’t dare open her mouth.

So instead she stood up and looked at the table. Dinner was cold.

Maybe some of the neighbors would know what was happening. She didn’t have a chance to open the front door; It vanished without any fanfare, just stopped being there.

Her jaw was shaking when she walked outside, and her teeth gritted, and when a plank of wood disappeared under her hooves a squeak escaped her throat, and she realized it was harder and harder for her to breathe.

There weren’t any neighbors. Just open sea all around her.
