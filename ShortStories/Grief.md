## Grief

**\(A possible outcome, years down the road\)**

Natan entered the kitchen and, before even being fully aware of what was happening, took the spear tip off Leaf's hooves. His recently bent leg nearly made him lose balance.

Silence.

Dripping. Blood and tears.

Natan threw the spear tip away, not caring of where it fell, and put a hand over Leaf's shoulder.

His neck bled. It wasn't deep enough a wound to worry about, certainly not the deepest.

Someone entered the kitchen and exited immediately.

Dripping. Sobbing.

Natan pulled him into a hug.

Wounded flesh he didn't know the pain off, but he did aching hearts.

Leaf shouted, his wings smoking as he flung them again, again, thunder screaming off them like vicious whips, spear on his hooves. Natan could only try to cover his back as the Pegasus forgot all about defence to repel their assailants, well trained flotilla soldiers bearing crescent moon badges.

Leaf shouted. Cried. He stopped fighting, and fell silent.

Someone climbed Natan's large chassis, and someone else, and another in a growing pile of armored bodies that was quickly becoming too heavy for him to move despite his size.

"Leaf!"

No answer.

An earth pony was readying a sword aimed at Leaf's chest. Natan's chassis was starting to buckle under the heavily armored ponies.

Bronze steps over grass.

Nitzan charged onto the would-be killer of Leaf, her steel-plated shoulder hitting his head with a loud clang. Others, also of Natan's crew, took care of the ponies pilling over him.

The battle over, Nitzan looked at Leaf silently for a moment and walked away, the word in her mind clear in the enraged way she moved.

'Weak.'

"Leaf?" Asked Natan, walking uncomfortably with a damaged chassis, bent leg, and cracked lens.

The Pegasus only stared at the body in front of him, both completely silent. Blood streamed off both.

Leaf's, from a myriad of wounds.

The soldier's, from the spear in his gut.

"I hate this." Said Leaf quietly, apathetically.

Natan put a hand on his shoulder.

"I hate her."

"It's fine."

"It's my fault."

Natan tightened his grip, "it's not."

"You don't know that."

Nitzan returned, carrying a tied stallion.

"Got the Captain." She dropped Victor on the grass and walked off again, not deigning give a last glance to Leaf.

The doors of the restaurant opened with a bang. The patrons looked at the newcomer with a mix of emotions, then relaxed. Just the owner.

Nitzan looked away from the griffon she was talking with, "Far away?" She asked curiously. He wasn't due for another day.

Natan didn't need to ask. Leaf dragged his wings, held his head low, had reddened eyes, carried the spear.

"I," He started, voice dry. "I would like to ask," A sob cut him, "To ask for five minutes ofâ€”"

He stopped talking, some clarity shining in his eyes, and walked to Natan at the bar.

"What am I doing." He asked quietly to no one.

Nitzan talked, the griffon forgotten. "Where's Sea?"

"She'd say, 'Why should they care.'" Leaf ignored her. "Not even ask it. Just say it."

Natan turned around and asked the patrons to return later, reimbursing their orders. The musicians didn't need to be told to stop playing. It wasn't a night for business.
