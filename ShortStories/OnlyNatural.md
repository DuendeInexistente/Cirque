## It's only natural.

**\(Of a grown up to have some needs\)**

Leaf swung her tail splashing, hot water around the bathroom, and searched around blindly for a towel. _Say what you may about the sea_, he thought, _but at least the towels are great. And they all smell of Cinnamon for some reason._ No shampoo, though. And he didn't trust what was used around these parts.

A door opened somewhere else in the house-- Cas' house, actually, so it wasn't hard to guess who it was. Then the bathroom door opened, which was only so surprising seeing as how this was Cas of all mares.

"Thanks for letting me use it," He said shyly, sliding away from the her. Cas was back home, and not quite sober from the way she walked. "I--"

"What if," She stopped talking for a split second, "What if you thank me more directly."

"Cas, please." Leaf repeated the phrase that was starting to turn into a mantra when near her. "You are drunk."

"Only a little spiked." She said pleasantly.

"Don't you think this is a little sudden?" His flanks hit a corner of the room. "Don't you think all of your, uhm--"

"Crush?" She offered.

"Don't you think it was kinda fast from you?"

"Maaaybe?" She singsonged, but stopped advancing to him.

"How do you know I am not the wrong guy?"

"Leaf, I am good at judging ponies."

"Er, how so?" He asked, backed into a literal corner and hoping to stall her.

"Oh, my job, my job…" She rolled her eyes, "I have to tell if a pony's dangerous the moment I see them."

"Really?"

"It's hard to when moonlighting." She rolled her eyes. "So dark, but it's the way things work."

"Uh."

"Not as many mares as you'd think." She seemed confused by this.

"Cas?" Said Leaf, realizing that she hadn't even mentioned having a job before.

"You know what do I want to do?" Asked Cas, "Do it on the day too."

"On the day?" He couldn't help asking.

"Where everyone can see it." She said, still talking pleasantly, then hiccuped. "It'd be so… So daring."

Leaf didn't answer, only blushing deeply.

"Are you okay?" She asked, as if remembering that he was there at all.

"It'sOkayIWon'tJudge." He said without thinking.

"I knew you wouldn't." She pulled him into a clumsy hug. "You are a good friend, Leaf."

The physical contact felt awkward after the revelation, but Leaf forced himself to relax and, against his expectations, found it soothing.

"You'll get back home." She added.

"Thanks."

"You know what, you and your friend'd be good at it too."

The awkwardness returned.

"She's got the physique, now she'd only need subtlety." She wandered off another drunken tangent. "And maybe a wardrobe too."

The mental image Leaf got wasn't unpleasant, but it wasn't one he felt comfortable with either.

"Will you stay for dinner?" Asked Cas. "Have I tasted your cooking yet?" She paused for effect, eyes lidded. "I'd also like your co--"

"I got to go." He said suddenly, surprised by it himself. "I er got to practice and, uh, to practice."

"See you later." She walked off the bathroom unfazed.

On his way home, Leaf tried not to think of Cas and Sea in scant clothing. He gave up on it after a few streets.
