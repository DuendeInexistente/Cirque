After decades doing a job that oftimes needed them to be either sexless or to play the part of either sex, the thief that some knew as Starry Eyes often wondered if they *could* genuinely act like their sex naturally rather than remind themselves to— this was one of those questions they often thought about but never asked anyone out loud. Was it sexlesness to have to play the role consciously, or was it more sexual than most people? When had they decided to make a joke out of it, because it was a game if you could poke fun at other people with it?

Because these were the things starry-eyed would often wonder about when they looked at their dresser, alone with no one to distract them— and loneliness was becoming a more and more common occurrence nowadays…

But to keep their mind busy they stretched a hoof and decided they’d be a mare this time, because it was the easier role to play, and grabbed a coctail dress that wouldn’t be too overproduced for a discretely classy bar but would attract some looks nonetheless. Her mane, long but not too long, was tied loosely into a braid already, and a small necklace would attract the eye to her neck and make the eyes then raise to her face, something which always satisfied her.

The lights of the hallways under deck made them look dim and dirty and quiet, with only the vague groans of shifting wood and the glimmers of enamel decoration on the closed doors, and after drifting across them she reached a bar that only seemed to encapsulate the melancholy of the place more than the rest of the ship, with the lights having a golden tone and the few patrons there were murmuring quietly among themselves, only maybe two or three sitting along the bar. So much for finding conversation, thought diamond-eyes, regretting having boarded this ship.

It was too attuned with how she felt for this to end well.

But she didn’t let that stop her from sitting at the bar near a bored-looking stallion, whipping her tail to wrap it around her waist to cover her underbelly out of habit.

The stallion -acceptably handsome and wearing the signs of hardship with some, distracted, pride- looked her way but didn’t talk immediately, instead going back to looking at his drink thoughtfully.

The barmare asked her what she wanted. ‘Barnacle poison’, she said, and this time the joke didn’t seem so funny when the barmare thought she was crazy, so she just shook her head and asked for whatever.

The soft whispers of distant conversations and living were the only sounds for a time after that.

------------------

He woke up feeling odd. Masculine for one— something rare indeed, when was the last time he had, years ago now? And it never was a good sign…

The mare in bed with him wasn’t as rare, though, and he wiped the feverish sweat off his forehead before lifting the blanket to check on *things*, because he wasn’t quite sure that the mare -white and with a pretty blue mane- was indeed a mare.

His blood froze.

He jumped off the bed, tore off whatever he was wearing -the ache on his shoulders and the heat on his back told him he’d been using his arms, *never* a good sign either- and broke into the shower, unsure and uncaring of whether he’d opened or shattered the doors in his way. Was this a dream? Questioning that, he pulled a copper chain that made cold water rain on him, drowning every other sound in the world, even the whistling on the back of his mind and the questioning on his ears and even the attempts to remember who was this mare, what had happened—

-*a stallion, mounting her as a ‘joke’, her hoof, moving on its own to break his leg*-

—Someone knocked the door.

Diamond-eyes knocked his head on the wall. *Go away. Go away. Go away.*

 “Miss?” Asked a young colt.

 *Go away.*

He was filthy. Too filthy to see or to talk with anyone. Sweat poured out and his arms hurt, ached, were rotten and needed to be cut for good, and that was only the filth outside. He feared what might happen if he talked with the colt. He feared what might happen if he had to lift a hoof near anyone.

-----------------------

 “Your son?”

The stallion nodded to her question, swirling his glass lazily, “Sonuva bitch bailed on me with the painting. Lost us a good deal.”

 “Well, maybe he had his reasons…”

 “Maybe.” His lip twitched a little. “You have any, miss?”

 “Too few.” Now she was the one who looked down on her drink, smiling softly because the alternative was to think of a certain colt she’d taught to. “You just want to find him, don’t you?”

 “If he does that to his own father,” The stallion sipped some of his wine, “What will he do to a stranger? You can’t have a respectable life like that.”

 “It’s not the path I’d want for mine. If you want someone who finds people I know some…”

 “I don’t need damn help to find my own damn son.” He said brusquely. She didn’t let her smile fade and expected him to apologize halfheartedly.
 
A small insect, sign of the season to come, buzzed to the sweet amber oil in her glass and became stuck in it, and even though she was distantly aware that she was supposed to take it out, even thought Starry could’ve punched a hole through steel, she felt like she didn’t have the energies to take the insect out of her drink.

 “Have you lost any, miss?”

Her smile faded. How would she tell his mother? Her chest tightened and her shoulders hurt and she thought, absently, that she was supposed to breathe, but her throat hurt with something too large to say, and which was for someone else to hear. ‘Have you lost any?’

Had she?

He wasn’t hers. She had no right to, to…

Hadn’t she helped raise him?

Not well enough, it seemed.

 “Sorry.” This time he did apologize, and it was heartfelt. “Sorry.”

 ‘Don’t be’, was what she was supposed to say, but didn’t.

 “I lost one.” He nearly whispered. “I ought to help the other.”


-----------------------

They were supposed to be sleeping.

There were many things they were supposed to do. Many, too, which they weren’t.

Starry Eyes touched the fabric of the mask. The inexpressive blue lenses surrounded by dark purple cloth stared at nothing, under the shadow of a wide wide hat. 

It felt so familiar. This mask of enchanted fabrics had indirectly led to a marriage, children, and a divorce, to an apprentice and to what almost was a lover…

No, not the mask.

Their character. The mask only helped that happen.

How could anyone fall in love with such a face, with swirly black and two frigid blue eyes?

A marriage ended bitterly, an apprentice who had died
























==============

A colt, no, a stallion who didn’t mind being seen as younger than he was, with a laugh so honest you just yearned to hear it, with cries so pained you yearned to fix whatever caused them.

But they knew the answer, didn’t they? Play with the dark. Dare its mysteries and unravel the frigid cold of it, have fun *wondering*, playing with the unknown… That was the way they’d made people fall in love with the thief. Playing their games, together, just two children of the night who found each other…

A colt, young and naive, who had chased them when they poked fun at him. A colt who Starry had seen had talent for their trade, and who gleefully accepted the position of apprentice. A colt who, after being introduced to the blue eyes, had grown a world-class athlete under their tutelage.

They hadn’t taught him well enough that he didn’t get killed.

I might as well be a yellow-eyes, they thought, for all the good I do.


====================


“Miss, we have to go.”

He knocked his head on the wall, harder. No. No! He wasn’t some wet hen, he was Starry Eyed! He was the only one, the only one, of the blue eyes to have shown himself in public in nearly a century, and gotten away with it! He knocked his head again, hard enough to cave it in this time, and still feeling disgusted and monstruous forced himself out of the shower
