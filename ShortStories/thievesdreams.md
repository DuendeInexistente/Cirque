The thief, known to some as Starry Eyes and to very few as Sweeper, wore dark purples and blacks; This was tradition as much as it was practical. Their cloak was long, and their hat wide and with a red feather; They liked dressing that way *and* tradition also called for it. Their boots were heavy with metallic disks wrapped in muffling cloth and their lenses were of resilient, bright cyan glass. These were all enchanted, the thief liked the way it looked and the things it let them do, and yet again, tradition demanded them.

Can't be one of the Blue Eyes without the blue eyes, you see.

Smooth like a cat, the thief ran across town, metaphorically and figuratively running away from sorrow. This time it wasn't a prize that they chased after, even thought it would be prized. It was not money either.

They were about to miss their ship, and staying in this city for another day would drive them crazy.

So they ran, and if you had seen them -fat chance- you would've been unable to tell if they were a stallion or a mare. And if, fatter chance even, they cared enough about you to stop running for an instant, they might've acted like a mare only to switch to a stallion without other reason reason than teasing and confusing you.

Thought if they had liked you enough to do that, they might've asked you to board the ship with them. God knows the thief regretted the causes of their loneliness now.

------------------

Once outside their suit, the thief always paused upon opening the door to others, having to remind themselves to act consistently as either sex. To most of her family, she was a mare, though strangers were fair play as far as he cared. They dressed accordingly, because they liked clothing, and they tried to be consistent in their daily life, but that didn’t change the one thing.

The whole joke about teasing people might’ve gone too far, because over time acting as either sex became something they had to *remind themselves* about. Had they pushed sex out of their inner core and made themselves sexless, or were they more sexual than most people who rarely thought about it?

These were the things Starry would often wonder about when they looked at their dresser, alone with no one to distract them— and loneliness was becoming a more and more common occurrence nowadays…

But to keep their mind busy they stretched a hoof and decided they’d be a mare this time, because it was the easier and most common role to play, and grabbed a coctail dress that wouldn’t be too overproduced for a discretely classy bar but would attract some looks nonetheless. Her mane, long but not too long, was tied into a loose braid already, and a small necklace would attract the eye to her neck and make the eyes then raise to her face, something which always satisfied her.

The lights of the hallways under deck made things look dim and dirty and quiet, with only the vague groans of shifting wood and the glimmers of enamel decoration on the closed doors, and after drifting across them she reached a bar that only seemed to encapsulate the melancholy of the place more than the rest of the ship, with the lights having a golden tone and the few patrons there were murmuring quietly among themselves, only maybe two or three sitting along the bar. So much for finding conversation, thought Starry Eyes, regretting having boarded this ship.

It was too attuned with how she felt.

But she didn’t let that stop her from sitting at the bar near a bored-looking stallion, whipping her tail to wrap it around her waist to cover her underbelly out of habit.

The stallion -acceptably handsome and wearing the signs of hardship with some, distracted, pride- looked her way but didn’t talk immediately, instead going back to looking at his drink thoughtfully.

The barmare asked her what she wanted. ‘Barnacle poison’, she said, and this time the joke didn’t seem so funny when the barmare thought she was crazy, so she just shook her head and asked for whatever.

The soft whispers of distant conversations and living were the only sounds for a time after that.

------------------

He woke up feeling odd. Genuinely masculine for one— something rare indeed, when was the last time he had, years ago now? And it never was a good sign…

The mare in bed with him wasn’t as rare, though, and he wiped the feverish sweat off his forehead before lifting the blanket to check on *things*, because he wasn’t quite sure that the mare -white and with a pretty blue mane- was indeed a mare.

His blood froze.

He jumped off the bed, tore off whatever he was wearing -the ache on his shoulders and the heat on his back told him he’d been using his arms, *never* a good sign either- and broke into the shower, unsure and uncaring of whether he’d opened or shattered the doors in his way. Was this a dream? Questioning that, he pulled a copper chain that made cold water rain on him, drowning every other sound in the world, even the whistling on the back of his mind and the questioning on his ears and even the attempts to remember who was this mare, what had happened—

-*a stallion, laying a hoof on her. Her hoof, moving on its own to break his leg*-

—Someone knocked the door.

Diamond-eyes knocked his head on the wall. *Go away. Go away. Go away.*

 “Miss?” Asked a young colt.

 *Go away.*

He was filthy. Too filthy to see or to talk with anyone. Sweat poured out and his arms hurt, ached, were rotten and needed to be cut for good, and that was only the filth outside. He feared what might happen if he talked with the colt. He feared what might happen if he had to lift a hoof near anyone.

-----------------------

 “Your son?”

The stallion nodded to her question, swirling his glass lazily, “Sonuva bitch bailed on me with the painting. Lost us a good deal.”

 “Well, maybe he had his reasons…”

 “Maybe.” His lip twitched a little. “You have any, miss?”

 “Too few.” Now she was the one who looked down on her drink, smiling softly because the alternative was to think of a certain colt she’d taught to. “You just want to find him, don’t you?”

 “If he does that to his own father,” The stallion sipped some of his wine, “What will he do to a stranger? You can’t have a respectable life like that.”

 “It’s not the path I’d want for mine. If you want someone who finds people I know some…”

 “I don’t need damn help to find my own damn son.” He said brusquely. She didn’t let her smile fade and expected him to apologize halfheartedly.
 
A small insect, sign of the season to come, buzzed to the sweet amber oil in her glass and became stuck in it, and even though she was distantly aware that she was supposed to take it out, even thought Starry could’ve punched a hole through steel, she felt like she didn’t have the energy to lift an insect.

 “Have you lost any, miss?”

Her smile faded, how would she tell the mother? Her chest tightened and her shoulders hurt and she thought, absently, that she was supposed to breathe, but her throat hurt with something too large to say, and which was for someone else to hear. ‘Have you lost any?’

 “Sorry.” This time he did apologize, and it was heartfelt. “Sorry.”

 ‘Don’t be’, was what she was supposed to say, but didn’t.

 “I lost one.” He nearly whispered. “I ought to help the other.”

-----------------------

They were supposed to be sleeping.

There were many things they were supposed to do. Many, too, which they weren’t.

Starry Eyes touched the fabric of the mask. The inexpressive blue lenses surrounded by dark purple cloth stared at nothing, under the shadow of a wide wide hat. 

It felt so familiar. This mask of enchanted fabrics had indirectly led to a marriage, children, and a divorce, to an apprentice and to what almost was a lover…

How could anyone fall in love with such a face, with swirly black and two frigid blue eyes? Look where it had gotten them…

A marriage ended bitterly, an apprentice killed, and a budding lover driven to coldness. 

No, this… this wasn’t them. They closed the box it was in and slid into the bed, trying not to think. Mania. Was it mania to fall for someone, not once but *twice*? Was it pathetic that they had ruined it both times?

Might as well be a yellow eyes, they thought, for all the good I do.

They took the mask out of its box and held it. It was heavy for cloth, enough that wearing it would’ve given muscle cramps to most people, but that was the price to pay for the level of protection it gave.

Under the mask were four disks, enchanted metal to be attached to their boots. Two were tied now, the other two were loose and glimmering as if they weren’t centuries old.

No. This wasn’t them. They closed the box and slid into bed, trying not to think about things.

They took the mask out of its box to wear the boots, feeling vaguely comforted by their weight and tightness.

Something hit the upper decks of the ship. They opened the box, and unfolded their cape to see it better: Large, ridiculously so, the dark purple cloth had small metallic sheets here and there, placed to protect the shoulders and column. They slipped into bed. They opened the box, and undustied the large hat with its feather.

-------------------------
 
 “Miss, we have to go.”

*Go away.* 

-------------------------

She was wandering the hallways of the ship now, trying not to think, worried what her thoughts might wander to. There was a ball somewhere nearby, or at least the music of one whispered softly.

She remembered him dressing up nicely, a colt in the spring of his life who could keep his cool with a gun aimed at his face -thought she attempted to avoid this- but was fretting because he didn’t have anyone to take to the ball.

He’d been a good student. If only she was a teacher to match…

A mare whined nearby, in equal parts bothered and worried.

It was as good of an excuse as any. Starry trotted to its source, turning around a corner to see a stallion pushing way past a small mare’s comfort zone, nearly sticking his face to hers. His friends weren’t surrounding her, nothing of the sort, but they stood just a few paces away.

She was small and white, like a petite marble statue that decided to move, with a graceful air to the bangs of her hair and the way she moved, and her voice was soft and gently melodious.

 “Maybe my issue is that you’re a dick.” She said.

The stallion, who seemed to believe he had a rough charm to his smile, pressed closer, “Maybe your issue is you’re a bitch.”

 “That’s not an issue.” She said frankly. “And I am lovely, dick.”

Did this mare even need help? What was the point of coming if she didn’t get to punch anyone? She considered the possibility of provoking him or one of his friends. That’d give the petite mare a chance to slip away quietly, too.

 “You got a lovely flank.” conceded the rough stallion, “And I think it needs a dick. That’s all.”

Hey, escalation!

No, bad. Don’t be happy about that.

 “I got tights that would snap your dick in half.” She was the one pushing her face onto his this time, her tone so crude even the stallion was taken aback by it. He looked back at his friends, who weren’t sure either but egged him forward.

Was Starry supposed to defend the mare, or to take them to separate timeout corners— Wearing chastity belts for good measure? She had raised kids already, and it was too late for this… She turned around, but the stallion noticed her and barked her way.

Sweet merciful heaven, what now?
