Cobalt Cuirass had done much in his life— he’d been a knight of various causes for the last fifty years, and a mercenary for thrice that before, and at the end of the day there were few things life had not readied him for.

Boredom, and small talk, were two of those things.

Oh, boredom was fine. Boredom was when you had money and could afford to do nothing, but having to do small talk -Because the sight of an armored minotaur with a young dragon did, indeed, attract people rather than scare them away- somehow made it worse. It had to be an engaging sort of boredom, then.

Still and after all the monstrosities he’d seen in his long, long life as a fighter, he could both remind himself that there were worse things, and was unable to bring himself to add to the grief.

Ponies and tritons had it especially bad these days— Tritons, bunch of bastards they were, had a stick all for themselves. He sometimes wondered if that’s why they were bastards.

But there came a moment that he simply grew tired of waiting for the ceremony to end, and whistled to let Diva know he was heading back.

This is what he said when Twilight asked him why had he flown away from the ceremony early, prompting the taciturn minotaur to keep explaining minuscule details. She had told him she wasn’t mad in that way which says ‘but I could be if I wanted to.’

 “You were bored?” She asked.

 “Exactly.”

The god said a lot with almost nothing when she wanted to. This is what the small shift of her lip did now, and the sharpening of her eyes.

 “I pulled your feathers.” He said, because she was expecting him to.

 “Not as much as you could have.” She conceded without bothering to pretend it was graciousness on her part. “And no, it doesn’t mater. But every single little thing off in the *aesthetic*… Is that a word still, Cobalt? I am not sure of which words are in use.”

 “You mean I didn’t make you look worse, but could’ve made you look better.”

She nodded a small nod, looking like a lean but muscular minotauress. Cobalt wondered idly how hard would he need to hit her to break the shell and see what she really looked like, and as if reading his thoughts she smiled a bitter smile and said, “Not as hard as you might imagine. But what’s under… that’s a very hard pony indeed. Enough to fight Tanatos.”

He didn’t acknowledge to being caught red handed, instead looking out a nearby window, sitting in a room with walls of old and unpainted wood, in a boat that waved softly with the water.

 “Word is sharper than the sword and blunter than the fist, anyhow; you could just ask me to show you.”

He shrugged. Not interested enough, if the goddess had a reason to put on a suit.

 “What are you doing now?”

 “Wandering.” He admitted. “No jobs here. Landly’s not the sort of city where I find them.”

 “I understand Arabesco was a more reliable employer?”

 “Arabesco was more *everything*. All kinds of folks from all kinds of places, of course some of them needed the muscle I have.”

Diva whistled from the deck and, a minute later, climbed down the stairs, nodded a greeting to Twilight, and muttered that the boiler was nearly ready and their crew would have them on their way in just a few minutes, then curled around Cobalt’s body for warmth and fell asleep quickly doing what, if asked, he’d insist was not a purr.

 “He’s cold blooded.” Said Cobalt thoughtlessly.

 “It’s a pity what happened to Arabesco.” Whispered Twilight, looking at the sleeping dragon.

 “Give it twenty or thirty years. It’ll be good as new.” Said Cobalt distractedly as he laid a hand on Diva’s neck, on one of his scars to warm it.

[Quilroy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVr4eee_BRQ) [^meinat] dragged his claws through surroundings that were becoming increasingly hard to make out, feeling the remains of his body ache after the effort he’d gone through. The stone was starting to vanish in his perception as the simulacrums of eyes in his helmet vanished, stripping away to increasingly abstract representations that were hard to tell apart from each other.

There was a sound -because his ears were, thankfully, still his original ones- of claws on stone and someone helped him stand— the griffon’s features were hard to make out as the stone, but he saw the small ring hovering above her head like a crown, spasming left and right sometimes before returning to a smooth spin, and knew who it was.

 “Querer?” He faked incertitude, because it put people at ease.

 “Yes, my lord. Why didn’t you call for me?”

He could’ve lied, but decided against it, “I felt my throat might tear.”

 “You fought again, did you not?”

 “*Noblesse oblige*, Querer. I made a statement at the ceremony.”

 “What kind of statement for a king is to enter battle without his people? To be weak and frail?”

 “That of a king that needs no army.” He said weakly, fully aware that his trembling legs contradicted it.

 “And look where it got you.”

 “Let an old friend mingle by himself, ser…”

Finally they reached his royal quarters at the ship, a discrete but well furnished room with silver and gold etchings on the walls, and he was deposited on the bed at its center with utmost care. All of his eyes kept darting back to Querer’s crownet-wheel every time it jerked suddenly.

“Do you hurt?” Asked Querer. 

 “Yes.”

 “What did you do?”

  “It was an unicorn.” He muttered, curling up in the nestlike bed, “He had might and rage both.”

 “Oh, Kuil…”

 “But I pushed him off… think I broke something.” 

 “Clearly not enough.”

Quilroy could’ve said that he suspected the unicorn’s cutie mark was a starburst— that his talent was *magic*, and if he didn’t feel on the verge of passing out would’ve done so to boast. But as it was it would only worry Querer unnecessarily, which was a dreadful idea for several reasons.

 “A griffoness wanted to see you.” Muttered Querer as if afraid that he’d fallen asleep. “Would you believe it, that she was bright pink?”

Quilroy just shook his head, intent on falling asleep precisely -the abstract patterns of his royal bed were simpler, but still complex enough to give him a royal headache- and watched as Querer slid out of the room with what he supposed was a sway of her hips.

Her crownet kept moving jerkily left and right all the while, like an engine about to break.

[Shemosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ca5AH9o8wU)[^pambo] sat on the edge of his troupe’s barge grumpily -his long cape resting on the boards nearby- wanting to not be seen. The already abundant scars on his skin had new additions now, several small burns and purples and a caved in head that he knew would be noticeable for at least a month after it got better, and more offending than injuring, the corners of his mouth hurt slightly.

But wishes seldom come true by sheer force of want -a fact every triton was familiar with- and sooner than later one of his people ‘sneaked’ in behind him and watched, idle, before speaking. “Was it bad?”

 “Bugger off.”

 “Thought so. Who did that?” Shemosh didn’t to look to know he was pointing at his face.

 “No one I couldn’t punch back. Bugger off.”

Sindias didn’t bugger off.

 “What happened?”

 “Bugger off.”

 “You know it leaves a bad taste on our mouths you do this for us, don’t you?”

 “Bugger off.”

The triton kissed Shemosh’ cheek, “So it makes me feel bad to be *thankful* for it. Feels like enabling.”

 “Bugger off.”

 “You only have yourself to blame.”

Shemosh found himself growling.

 “*That* bad, huh. You got a spot on the rehearsal if you feel like it.” 

Shemosh said nothing, and sat still as the others practiced their acrobatics behind him. To think he’d thought it might not be so bad…

Someone fell behind him. He didn’t need to see it, just to hear the panicked squeak of someone who hasn’t yet realized the importance of their mistake.

Shuga was falling, and soft bodies can only do so much— he knew with a glance that she was about to spill her brains out on the soft paneling.

The wood bent under him.

He knew that the air boomed around him, and that the there was here without the here ever changing, and then Shuga was in his arms. He didn’t have time to braze for impact, only to turn Shuga around forcefully so she’d fall on their legs. She cried out in pain when a bone was bent not to a breaking point, but  still to an incredibly painful one.

The others didn’t stop to gasp, as such a mistake was dreaded but expected from rookies, and before Shemosh knew it they were rushing, orderly but implacably carrying both of them to a tent on the platform. He was twisted, oiled, cuddled and bandaged and perfumed for the next several hours, unable to get the others to listen and *bugger the fuck off already* no mater how much he cursed at them. Sindias was between the scenes all the while, directing the others and, he was sure the instant he saw her, ensuring no one had the presence of mind to quite register Shemosh’ grunts.

At last he laid alone near a guilty-looking Shuga, who looked like she wished nothing more than for Styx to swallow her down.

 “I hate you.” He grunted, feeling both exhausted and feverishly angry at once.

 “You don’t mean that.” Said Sindias, sitting patiently near him.

He grunted noncomitally. Nothing pissed him off more than being caught redhanded.

 “You were wounded. I simply… took the chance. Was it an unicorn again? Giving you that look you hate?”

 “There was an unicorn.” Was all he wanted to say, but then he added: “But no. He wasn’t the racist one.”

 “Did you try…”

 “Sindias, my mouth feels like it’ll fall off from smiling.” He cut her off.

 “It looks like it’s falling off.” She said crudely, but laid a comforting hoof on his shoulder. “I understand. It’ll be fine.”

He laid still, wondering if he was shaking. His chest felt hot and pained, like it was filled to a bursting point, and he tried to keep it under control. He could do this, he knew he could, only had to try a little harder, just be an adult…

 “There was an unicorn too.” He repeated, and gulped “I… had to fight with him, with a weird griffon.”

 “Did the unicorn do that?” She asked. “Your head?”

 “I think.” Breathe in and out, he told himself, counting his breaths to ten. “It was a big fight, there was all sort of shit being flung.”

His words bled out, little by little, and by nightfall he almost felt like he didn’t want to scream on someone’s face. Almost.
