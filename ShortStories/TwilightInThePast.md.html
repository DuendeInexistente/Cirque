Twilight Sparkle was stepping out of the university when a younger unicorn saw her and, visibly glad, trotted across the boardwalk to try reaching her, his saddlebags swinging wildly, &quot;Professor Coruscante! Wait!&quot;

And she winced, just a little bit and with her face which wasn't his way, but <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">walked slower</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>, because she still couldn't bring herself to stopping. Not with a good brunch waiting for her.

 &quot;Yes, Star Tracker?&quot;

The stallion -more of a colt, truly- seemed ashamed to be addressed by name, but didn't let that stop him. &quot;It's just that I still don't understand this line.&quot; He took a book from one of his bags and flipped quickly to a marked page, &quot;See?&quot;

 &quot;Well, Cirs aren't known for being straightforward.&quot; Twilight took the book herself and turned it around to read the tight writing. &quot;Ah. It's saying that alicorns are creatures molded by mythical forces, remember that we talked about those in class?&quot; She gave back the book and recited, smiling, &quot;'Consider, then, the existence of alicorns -did they exist- as holistic and bound to a force...'&quot;

He nodded quickly. &quot;But that's what I don't get, alicorns don't exist. And I thought this book was going to suggest, I don't know, imply that they're just an idea, but even this...&quot;

 &quot;They're the same as minotaur <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">ree-eid-les</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> or griffon <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">Gold Bones</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>. That's what makes them holistic-&quot; If she addressed him by name the colt might have died of embarrassment so, enjoying the conversation more than she had expected, Twilight decided to be more formal and addressed him by clan &quot;-, Dalagare, alicorns don't truly exist, yet they are a persistent part of pony mind of culture. They are holistic not just because they are a combination of the three races or because they are bound to an element of the world, but also because they Aah, need external forces to congeal three magics into a fourth, and Bee, are something we know to exist despite them not existing.&quot;

Star Tracker followed her while thinking about this for a while, giving her a chance to look at the scenery. Many members of the university often lamented the utter lack of decorations or even lights surrounding the boardwalk, but she understood why this was and approved of it. Nearby on the shallows, under the posts that supported the boardwalk, the curving sand beach was a pleasant, relaxing sight, slowly lowering until the water was just pure blue, and in the distance one could see the green of the archipelagos-and as she looked, a plane taking off under the bright moon. It was a vista that invited thoughtfulness.


 &quot;Alicorns are part of ponykind's whole?&quot; Tried Star Tracker. &quot;It's not an act of faith as some claim it to be. We know alicorns exist in the same way I can tell when there's magic or you could find seeds, because the fact is integral to us.&quot;

 &quot;It is an act of faith. Or at least, I see it as that. It's just one that is, maybe an emergent property,&quot; She laughed a little at the small joke, realizing a split second too late that she'd made a pig noise. &quot;Holistic by itself?&quot;

 &quot;Thanks for the help, and hey, did you hear of that number minotaurs made up?&quot;

 &quot;The tsei-ro?&quot;

 &quot;A number representing nothing, can you believe it?&quot;

 &quot;Not yet, Dalagare. But I am waiting for them to reply my letter. I will publish their answer on the gazette if you're interested?&quot;

Star Tracker and Twilight were reaching the borders of the university's grounds, entering the citadel that had spawned around the university. Originally it'd been made so far from the coast to provide the students silence and the right amount of isolation, but as people travels and money flows, business is given to follow.

It was still a quiet little town, however, which pleased her. The head of the university (A position she'd reach one day, just you wait) had imposed very strict sanctions when it came to noise, and curfews during the week.

Star Tracker was growing increasingly self conscious by the time they reached the first storefront, seeing himself obligated to keep the conversation going and wanting to say something stuck on his throat.

Another plane flew overhead, prompting them both to look up at it, and then at the still daymoon and the mare on it. It was said that each people (griffons, minotaurs, even breezies) saw their own species on it, even in photographs.

 &quot;Did you ever see the soon, teacher?&quot; He asked.

 &quot;The sun? No, I was too young to remember.&quot; Was Star Tracker tried to create a moment? She wasn't sure- he had a famously corny streak. Nevertheless, math happened on her mind quickly. &quot;This would be a crescent moon if we had it.&quot; But of course, they didn't, because nowadays the moon had to rush through its cycles to emulate day and night, and both daystars and nightstars blinked on and off weakly, barely visible even during the night.

 &quot;I thought it w... Miss?&quot;

Twilight turned to him and then to the spot he was looking at, curious. There were a few others on the boardwalk, even a siren, but it was obvious Tracker was not looking at any of them.

A large earth pony stood near a bakery, tall enough that (And part of Twilight wanted to test this) if she had stood on Star Tracker's back, then she <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">might</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> have been at eye level. Her deep purple coat was pristine, and her eyes, a light shade of yellow that still looked dirty somehow, were intent on the both of them.

No, not on <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">them</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>. Being looked at changed something, because then the mare, moving only slightly and lazily like a cat made of stone, shifted to stare directly at Twilight.

 &quot;Is... Is that someone you know, Coruscante?&quot; Tracker gulped, his horn sparking in preparation to do whatever it might need to do. &quot;It's someone who knows you at least.&quot;

 &quot;Let's not find out.&quot; Twilight pulled him by the horn (She was a teacher after all, and responsible for his well being) and walked away from the strange, oppressive mare.

<span class="PreProc">-----------</span>

 &quot;Just staring?&quot;

 &quot;Yes, she didn't try to follow me.&quot; Twilight had said it to quench the mare's doubt, but found herself glancing back at the entrance just in case. &quot;If she'd wanted any business with me she would've spoken, wouldn't she?&quot;

 &quot;Maybe it's an admirer.&quot; The discrete bar, never calm at this time of the day, burst with movement for a split second when the pink mare bounced more than walked to an incoming client. Twilight pecked at her brunch in the moment of peace, but soon enough the mare returned, smiling like she'd never gone away.

 &quot;It wasn't a flattering look, no.&quot; Twilight shook her head.

 &quot;What was it like?&quot;

 &quot;It was like, hm...&quot; Twilight did her best to imitate the stone faced expression, finding it unexpectedly easy. &quot;Like this.&quot;

 &quot;Hmm...&quot;

 &quot;It's not an admirer, Diane.&quot;

 &quot;<span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">Hmmm...</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>&quot;

 &quot;Or a secret party planner.&quot;

 &quot;He could be a <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">very</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> good one.&quot;

 &quot;Looking at me like she'd club me to death?&quot;

Diane did her best to mirror Twilight's expression, making her laugh- between the involuntary telephone game and Diane's bubbling personality, it wasn't particularly close to the mare's face.

 &quot;Do I look like I have a crush on and or am planning a special party for you?&quot; She asked, making a clear effort to keep the mean face on. It made her features tremble.

 &quot;Aaah no, still no, but I wouldn't rule out the possibility either.&quot;

Diane's features <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">exploded</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> into a smile as soon as she let them, and she talked halfheartedly. &quot;Have I ever told you that you're self important this time of the week, Twi?&quot;

 &quot;Miss Diane of the Rockadee, I am gorgeous in mind and body.&quot; Twilight smiled magnanimously, then that said, ate a mouthful of brunch in the most unladylike fashion she could.

Which, going by Diane's expression, was amusingly little. She opened her mouth for a retort, but a new client demanded her attention and she bounced off.

Twilight did, in fact, have a vague, distracted pride in her physique. Being an earth pony meant she felt obliged to standards, which included not a pretty rump -Not that it was necessary, <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">ThankYouVeryMuch</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>, she was aware it received a pleasant amount of looks from teachers and students alike- but to maintain level of fitness even if her scholarly life didn't demand it. To not do so would've been an affront to her heritage.

And here was Diane. A mare that could've been a ballerina if she'd wanted to, a famous one at that, but worked at a bar because she liked the conversation. Her fast movement belied the sheer, effortless grace of it.

It was enough to make anyone jealous, it was, no mater the race.

<span class="PreProc">--------------</span>

Being a polymath implied a certain status to uphold. Even when she'd been a student of the university (A status that she actually planned to return to relatively soon, if only partly, to get her next diploma) teachers and family had reminded her that, by starting out with topics as disparaging as folklore and materials science, she had to send a strong, visible message that she was indeed acknowledgeable about both topics and not spreading herself thin. For this reason, she had to be a prim and (Something that came more naturally to her) neat lady in public, else people wouldn't trust what she claimed to know, diplomas or no diplomas. Not until she amassed more success than she already had.

That stopped at home. The real home, not the rooms which she allowed formal guests into.

It wasn't just the books, most of which she was confident in being the legitimate owner of, piling on every available surface; those were expected and respected in a member of the academia. It wasn't the scorch marks from Spike's recent flu, or the pools of molten-and-solidified glass from when they attempted to reduce the fire risk during said flu with bubble helmets, or what Diane called Creative Disorder. It wasn't the books marked with food or hair or other, smaller books which might also be marked the same way. It was the book fort.

It hadn't been intentional. In his earlier years Spike had grown territorial and aggressively demanded his own boat by making a book fort and claiming all books its walls were made from his own. Twilight had given him his boat house -a small one for now- but the book fort had remained because when you have that volume of books, stairs and ladders become impractical. They use up space that could  be used by more books.

So it wasn't a fort. It was an aid to transit that shifted organically as her research and interests did, only kept away from her chemistry rooms and from positions where it might block doors. And she wasn't damaging the books either- the really delicate or unique ones had their own glass-covered shelves. <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">Or</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> in risk of collapse, because she knew a thing or two about construction.

So her library (an area that had slowly expanded to occupy a living room and dormitory until she surrounded an entire boat house to the books, and bought another at great expense) was, despite initial appearances, a rather sturdy and neat construction, as close to such a thing as one can get without nailing and tying the elements together. Books were piled from larger to smaller and only those that were fit for such a thing were used in the construction, the rest, piled on each other like bricks in such a way that one could remove them without risking collapse, and the bridges connecting the second level, well, she was proud of the bridges. It'd been a childhood dream come true when she figured out how to make those

And any similarities to a castle were either purely coincidental or convergent design.

Spike wasn't there when she opened the door, nor was there any sign that he'd eaten in the kitchen- the pantry was untouched, as was his 'secret' gem stash, and he wasn't sick because the bathroom was perfectly clean.

Or was he just sleeping in? Twilight navigated the library because it was the shorter path to Spike's boat house, a single roomer with a small engine that he'd nevertheless been avid in calling his own, and noticed the engine had some soot on it. Had he gone to the archipelago? Strange, because it was cool and the little dragon was unusually strict when it came to keeping it clean and well tuned. He'd even accepted when she offered teaching him mechanics on the weekends.

 &quot;Spike? Is anything wrong?&quot; She called him, not opening the door yet but ready to.

 &quot;Y-yeah! Just--&quot; Something meaty fell with a thud, eliciting a cry from him. &quot;Just let me--&quot;

<span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">Hold up</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>.

Spike acting like he'd been caught red handed, yet it was obvious he'd done nothing wrong, closed up in his room, where he'd gone with enough urgency as to even leave his engines dirty. Was what had fallen him, or someone else?

 &quot;Nevermind me.&quot; She backed off quickly. &quot;I've got to ah talk with parents, nevermind me.&quot;

<span class="PreProc">-----------</span>

It just so happened that she did have to talk with parents, an elderly couple who knocked her door worried about why was their colt avoiding them, and Twilight had to be very professional despite the recent awkwardness and tell them that while he looked just fine and his grades hadn't changed significantly, his friends would have better answers. Maybe a demanding marefriend, she ventured? Spike entered the kitchen while she was talking, hoping to a chair to get the good quartz and acting like nothing had happened.

Which was just ok. Twilight was good at pretend.

 &quot;How was your day?&quot; Asked Spike after the couple went away, then shoved a clawful of quartz into his mouth with exaggerated nonchalance. He was wearing the paperboy hat he liked wearing when he went to town, but nothing else, which seemed odd to Twilight given the situation.

 &quot;Yours?&quot; She asked automatically.

He shrugged and lifted his hands, cheeks puffed; 'Can't talk, mouth full.'

 &quot;Well, this otter barged into the comparative mythologies class...&quot; She took a seat at the table with him. &quot;One of my students had some chowder in his pack, you see, and it wouldn't have been so bad if pups hadn't followed her in.&quot; Spike gave her a questioning look. &quot;With half a dozen plus their mom and the way people treats otters here? The class was a petting zoo after that, nothing I could do. I changed the topic to otter-related myths to teach them <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">something</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> they'd pay attention to after that happened.&quot;

He swallowed with visible effort,  &quot;Nothing else?&quot;

 &quot;No?&quot; The tall mare came to mind, but she decided to stop thinking more about that. &quot;Nothing out of the ordinary. Head of research gave me dirty looks.&quot;

Spike gave her a look, and then kept looking, and when Twilight was starting to feel self conscious he dropped it, making a disinterested gesture with his hand- he'd been enthused with hand gestures ever since making friends with a few mainland dragons. &quot;Forget me, I was thinking aloud.&quot;

 &quot;Is... Anything wrong? You're not yourself today.&quot;

 &quot;Nah, nothing's wrong,&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I'll tell you about it later. But we're eating out today, right? It's Monday.&quot;

Twilight chuckled, &quot;You're just a bottomless barrel, aren't you? Of course, same place as last week.&quot;

 &quot;Sweet! And this time we are going before they run out of that sauce.&quot;

<span class="PreProc">------------------</span>

 &quot;Aw, man, you ran out again?&quot; Asked Spike, heartbroken.

Twilight said nothing. Speaking would've exposed her own disappointment.

<span class="PreProc">------------------</span>

Sauce or not Spike was unusually bright on their way back, telling her excitedly about the last episodes of his radio dramas; The far away pilgrim had found a necklace with the first half of a gem inside its locket. When he had both halves, he would... Do something cool with it. Twilight disagreed, because if it was two halves, it obviously meant that he and another person had to wear a half each to represent their unity as a team and as friends. Spike argued than that fell under the mantle of &quot;Something cool&quot;, which Twilight had to respectfully disagree with again: it would be either &quot;Something sweet&quot; or &quot;Something cheesy&quot;, or a mixture of the two. He protested about Twilight making his shows girly, but that didn't seem to dampen his mood any.

 &quot;And then...&quot; Spike, riding on her back, paused and turned around.

 &quot;What is it?&quot;

 &quot;I thought someone was looking at us.&quot; He said it without concern, but kept looking behind. &quot;A tall mare?&quot;

 &quot;Odd.&quot;

 &quot;Eh, we can kick the ass of anyone who helps.&quot;

 &quot;What are we, the far away pilgrims?&quot;

 &quot;Yes! Advanti!&quot; He stood on her back, placing a hand on the back of her head and pointing forward with the other.

 &quot;The word is avanti...&quot; Twilight stopped walking slowly. The lights of her boat were on. &quot;Did you...?&quot;

 &quot;You came out after me, remember?&quot; Spike hopped off her back. &quot;I go from the front and you from the back.&quot;

Twilight didn't like it when Spike put himself in as much danger as he could for her sake, but she had to concede the point to the little dragon- he was, factually, absurdly resilient compared to her. Having an engine explode on his face resulted in spending two days scrubbing the soot off his scales, and being punched would make him fall but not much else.

After reaching the house and going apart, they each crawled to their respective doors, Twilight trying to hear anything. There was whispering inside, albeit nothing that could be made out, but no one was visible through the windows. She assumed this meant the intrudes couldn't be more than one or two, which gave her a sense of relief as she pushed the door in just the right way to avoid any unsightly creek. No, she wanted to know the situation for sure before revealing her presence.

No one in the kitchen, maybe behind the counte-- Wait, why were they doing this instead of calling the poli--

The lights went off somehow.

Okay.

Okay <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">the light was bothering her eyes, which meant she had to still have semidecent nightvision. Hoofsteps- More than </span><span class="markdownItalic">**</span><span class="markdownItalic">don't panic</span><span class="markdownItalic">**</span><span class="markdownItalic"> three sets coming her way- but she knew the layout better than they probably did __don't freak out__</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>--

 &quot;<span class="markdownBold">**</span><span class="markdownBold">SURPRISE!</span><span class="markdownBold">**</span>&quot;

Twilight freaked out with a yelp, crashing into Diane when she ran and knocking the breath out of her.

 &quot;Impressive.&quot;

 &quot;Twiggy?&quot;

Diane managed to remain standing somehow, clutching her belly and trying to breathe evenly. And despite all this, she managed to talk: &quot;H... Happy... Birthday...&quot;

 &quot;Wuh.&quot;

Her father ran to Diane and helped her breathe.

 &quot;What did I miss.&quot; Twilight blinked quickly, shame about having hurt Diane flooding in quickly and mixing with the panic and surprise into the perfect recipe for dangerously moist eyes. &quot;Mom?&quot;

 &quot;It's your birthday.&quot; Said Spike, hopping off Twilight's Mother's back to check on Diane. &quot;I've been thinking you were on to me all day. Pie, you okay?&quot;

 &quot;No it's not.&quot; She argued automatically.

 &quot;It is.&quot; Gasped Diane, gaining her breath back.

<span class="PreProc">----------------</span>

It took a few minutes for things to get back to normal, but once Diane had her breath things started moving into motion- Twilight's parents had come with an unexpected guest, a well built, red-wine coated mare, whose reason to be there Twilight was avoiding like the plague: Her parents had always had crazy ideas about relationships, and why would they travel with a large and attractive mare, well, she wasn't eager to know what were they trying now.

 &quot;<span class="markdownBold">**</span><span class="markdownBold">I DO AND I WAS</span><span class="markdownBold">**</span>!&quot; Diane burst out of somewhere to Twilight's left when she was walking between the stove and the counter that divided the kitchen, ensnaring Twilight in a surprise hug and giving her another scare. &quot;See? Now I made my cool entry. So the party can really start now!&quot;

 &quot;Diane, I just headbutted you.&quot; Twilight giggled despite herself, unable to reciprocate the hug because it had trapped her arms. Was her mom adding alcohol to the punch?

 &quot;That just means I made the surprise too good!&quot; She let go. &quot;I am not mad, Twi, if I was mad I'd be like <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">grrr</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>&quot; She growled loudly, splaying her legs. &quot;See? But I can't be like that because it totally was my fault even if you have a really thick skull. And it's your birthday too! So I am <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">twice</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> as not mad.&quot;

 &quot;I'll make up to you.&quot; Twilight turned back to Diane to hug her back and thank her then noticed, for the first time, that she had dressed lightly for the occasion:There was a tasseled, deep red kerchief over her tail and flanks like a skirt, with barely visible black rose branch designs. She also wore a light yellow bandanna she especially liked -despite it not fitting with her own colors- with a flowerlike sun on it, which her mane poofed over as if about to break past it like a deluge. &quot;Well I feel underdressed now.&quot;

 &quot;Don't talk nonsense. You look great on that.&quot;

Twilight looked at herself. It was the same comfortable jacket, edging the dangerous -and acceptable only to teachers- line between homely and ugly, that she had worn every other day for the last year despite having the money to buy new ones. On top of all that, the only accessory she wore was the starbust medal on her chest, signaling her as part of the Coruscante clan.

 &quot;Dear sun I am a thirty years old single teacher.&quot; She realized with a measure of fascination. &quot;And I dress like a forty years old.&quot;

Her mother laughed on the other side of the room, shamelessly and loudly as she ever did, &quot;She thinks that's old...&quot;

 &quot;It's very you!&quot; Said Diane happily.

 &quot;I'll take that as an insult.&quot;

 &quot;Then we're even for the headbutt. Hi missus Velvet!&quot;

Twilight turned to her mother with a smile and grabbed her tight, squeezing until she complained, &quot;Thanks for coming this far just for me.&quot;

The old unicorn wheezed when Twilight eased her grasp... And then hugged Twilight even harder until she yelped, &quot;Thanks for having me, honey. Sorry for bringing a guest. And scaring you.&quot;

 &quot;Oh you're not the one I blame.&quot; Twilight, trying to appear unaffected by her mother's strength, stretched her neck to see behind Velvet's permanently messy mane, where Spike was trying to pass unnoticed.

 &quot;It was cooler in my head.&quot; He admitted after a few seconds of mean staring.

 &quot;Oh!&quot; Exclaimed Diane. &quot;I nearly forgot.&quot;

 &quot;Huh?&quot; Spike leaned forward. Velvet, maybe intuiting Twilight's plan or maybe just missing her, didn't disengage the crushing hug.

 &quot;It's a surprise.&quot; Diane gave her a small clay bottle. &quot;I heard you guys talk about something last week, so I thought I'd use my 'hood rep.&quot; She said that last part raspily and jokingly, but didn't stop offering the bottle until Twilight pocketed it.

Spike was very close to her, trying to look at the bottle. The fool.

Twilight grabbed him and <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">squeezed</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> as hard as she could in a hug against her mother's back, punishing him for setting her up for a scare.

<span class="PreProc">----------------------------</span>

The party was discrete after that- family gossip was flooded back and forth between, her parents glad to hear that Spike was reconnecting with his roots, and Diane made her way into the conversation with her usual ease despite barely knowing her parents at all. After a while, maybe realizing the conversation was exhausting her, the others walked away to the library so Spike could show off the structure's latest developments.

At first Twilight simply leaned on the isle counter and drank water, eyeing the birthday cake Diane had summoned <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">ex-nihilo</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> and which now rested on the counter, already missing several pieces.

So Spike wasn't sneaking a partner today, huh. It was part of setting this up. She laughed, realizing both of them had been so awkward for such disparate reasons- did Spike even know what she thought he'd been doing?

When she felt ready to rejoin the others, someone entered from the front door, surprising Twilight before she remembered who it was- The unexpected guest, maybe gone to smoke sometime. Thought her face was carefully neutral as to seem slightly offended, she seemed surprised that Twilight was the only one there.

 &quot;The others are on the back.&quot; She explained tiredly. The mare was mostly naked, but wore some sort of headpiece made of wires intertwined with her mane in a manner vaguely similar to braids. How much time did she spend on that each morning?

 &quot;You are Twilight, correct?&quot; Asked the mare. The voice was melodic, but somewhat butch. &quot;I was not aware this was a family meeting. My apologies.&quot;

 &quot;I don't think it was supposed to be.&quot; Twilight tried to laugh it off. &quot;I have another friend I would've expected, but she probably didn't have time to come.&quot;

Damn it.

Time to bite the bullet. Not like she wasn't curious.

 &quot;You came with mom and dad?&quot;

 &quot;We are heading the same direction.&quot; Explained the mare, walking to her. &quot;Just traveling acquaintances. They are... Curious.&quot;

 &quot;They are nuts.&quot;

 &quot;It's a way of putting it. Does your mother... Decide to characterize people often?&quot;

 &quot;Oh.&quot; It wasn't the first time her mother decided to add a person to one of her books. &quot;She's picking your brain?&quot;

 &quot;Indeed. And her curiosity is mighty.&quot;

There was something about the tone with which she said it, like a narrator in a radio play talking about a great warrior, that made Twilight laugh weakly.

 &quot;In poor hands it cuts what they can see,&quot; Started the mare, sitting near Twilight, &quot;In skilled ones, it cuts what no one can. What is?&quot;

 &quot;Curiosity?&quot; Replied Twilight. Was that a riddle? &quot;Or a pen. A lot of things.&quot;

 &quot;Including a sword. Which your mother's curiosity is, and if the dragon is to be trusted, yours as well.&quot; Explained the mare, dropping her mask of apathy to smile widely and frankly- and Twilight had some experience seeing past fake smiles.

 &quot;If either was a sword you'd be in pieces. Uhm, she's not bothering you, is she?&quot;

 &quot;Oh, I have no doubt if curiosity alone was lethal I'd have long since surrounded. But no, her probing is refreshing and I wonder what is it like to be a character in a book.&quot;

 &quot;Then you're on to freezing to death.&quot;

 &quot;Ha.&quot; Her single chortle was like a roar. &quot;I have something for you, if you will excuse me.&quot;

 &quot;Something? I... You don't have to make up a gift.&quot; She rushed to explain.

 &quot;It is no improvisation. What kind of guest would I be?&quot; The mare stood and walked outside without waiting for an answer.

Well...

Far better than she expected. No threesome hijinks today.

The mare was back quickly, and put a wrapped box on the counter near Twilight. It was boxed in such a way she couldn't tell the contents at a glance. &quot;The pink one insisted it be wrapped.&quot;

 &quot;She would.&quot; Twilight tried to take it, but the tall mare spoke up again.

 &quot;If it has to be hidden...&quot; She took the package from her hoof and put it back on the counter, &quot;I can tell you anything, yet can't talk or know anything at all. What am I?&quot;

 &quot;Another riddle?&quot;

 &quot;One I wonder <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">how</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> will you ask as much as <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">what</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>.&quot;

 &quot;In that case...&quot; Twilight replayed the riddle in her mind a few times, &quot;You can tell me <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">anything</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>, not <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">everything</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>. And of course <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">what</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>, not <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">who</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>.&quot;

 &quot;Think about it well, miss.&quot; The mare gave the cake a look, but decided against grabbing a piece.

 &quot;There's a lot that applies to, but is it a book? Or a record, but the box isn't large enough.&quot;

The mare just smiled, and let Twilight open the package this time. It was in fact a book, but an old and worn one, written by hoof.

 &quot;Is this yours?&quot;

 &quot;A hobby. Open it.&quot;

The pages were written carefully, like an old mare's writing, and in several languages. And page after page was filled with riddles.

 &quot;You really like them.&quot; Twilight nodded to herself. &quot;Griffon and pony languages, is that breezie? And siren?&quot;

 &quot;Indeed. My family travels much and collects them- this is just one of many journals, quite old.&quot;

 &quot;I don't know what to say.&quot; If the mare had been any different she would've taken it as being dumped trash on, but the book clearly had value, emotional and monetary. Some of the writing in this, among what she could read, was something others researching folklore would've torn each other apart for, proving or disproving personal theories about the evolution of language. &quot;And no translations anywhere?&quot;

 &quot;What for? Wordplay is idoneous to its own language. So is the nuance in many riddles.&quot;

<span class="PreProc">------------------</span>

The book was put in one of the glass vitrines of the library, which pleased the mare greatly, and after a few hours she and her parents took their leave, leaving Twilight, Diane, and Spike on the kitchen. They had talked until both of them were leaning on Twilight, the three of them feeling tired and not minding some afterhour cuddling.

 &quot;Tell us a tale.&quot; Said Diane after a lull in the conversation.

 &quot;A tale?&quot; Twilight thought about it for a moment. &quot;Do you know the story of Prince Cath?&quot;

The others shook their heads lazily.

 &quot;Well, griffons say he was a griffon <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">Gold-bones</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>, but sirens -the inland ones- say he was one of them too. His claws burned red like iron, and he traveled with a bird made of fire called the Phoenix. According to hippogriffs, he also only ever wore gold. Which is usually more characteristic to griffon--&quot;

Spike punched her weakly.

 &quot;&quot;kay, okay,&quot; She laughed. &quot;But near his kingdom there was a crack on the world, you see- Griffons say the entire kingdom had been built to contain it, while hippogriffs said it was the kingdom who made the crack somehow.&quot;

 &quot;Like a ravine?&quot; Asked Diane. &quot;How deep?&quot;

 &quot;No, not a ravine. It was a crack in the world, all traditional versions say this, past everything to its inside. Nothing that fell on came back, and light didn't even make it dark, and it was like there wasn't anything. But it was a crack. Because nothing grew there, and if you walked into it you fell off through the ground. And taint beasts came from it. One day, a snake came from it.&quot; Spike paid more attention now, ready for something exciting. &quot;So Prince Cath made his claws burn, wore his gilded armor, and rode to slay the beast. It slid like a snake on the land and, although it was killed many times, all who were touched by its blood were killed or turned into a new snake after the last died. Archers were rushed at, and warriors exhausted one after the next.&quot;

 &quot;What did it want?&quot; Asked Spike. He sounded sleepy.&quot;

 &quot;Griffons said it was offered gold, and hippogriffs a home, and both say it also refused sweet meats and many offerings. But it was a taint beast, and wished only mayhem- all who offered any sort of peace were slain. Prince Cath saw it and, hearing what had been of the others, chose to protect himself.&quot;

 &quot;Did he make all of himself burn?&quot; Asked Pinkie, joking -was Spike asleep?- &quot;Jump into a pyre?&quot;

 &quot;No. He <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">made</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span> himself one! He covered his armor, his whole body, in oiled silk and set it ablaze. Hippogriffs say it was with red coals but -I like this version better- griffons say he set himself in fire by force of will, making his claws burn brighter than ever, melting the gold his bones were made of until the oil caught fire. And like that he called the Phoenix, who was the only who could stand his heat, and with a trail of smoke marched to the taint viper. Its skin had no scales, only pulsating and rotten flesh that had many others retch, but Prince Cath was not affected.&quot;

 &quot;Easy, h'was smelling smoke.&quot; Muttered Spike.

 &quot;Maybe. Phoenix was the first to attack, swooping down on the viper. But limbs grew from the viper every time the Phoenix was about to cut it with its claws. Next was Ser Cath, who took a nearby tree and tore it off its roots, swinging it like a club. But the... The viper took the tree with its mouth and... and swallowed it whole.&quot;

 &quot;And...&quot; Tried to start Spike, before falling finally asleep.

Which was just ok. Twilight was falling asleep too.

Besides, she didn't like the ending.

<span class="PreProc">---------------------------</span>

She was transfixed by pain for an instant upon awakening, feeling her self return to the avatar of her choice, a giant phoenix. But the pain subsided quickly, and soon all she had was close-eyed wakefulness lulled by the sound of waves.

 &quot;You were dreaming.&quot; Said the Sphinx, sitting near her. &quot;Tells us what we are with our own voice. What is?&quot;

 &quot;I... Can't remember the dream.&quot; Twilight shuddered. Having lived as long as she had sometimes meant dreams had extra layers of puzzlement, collections from begone eras &quot;I think it was... Something from very long ago. Before I have any memory of.&quot; She shuddered again, the feeling of the dream echoing in her mind. &quot;But I was small, and weak.&quot;

Senses that couldn't be given analogues by mortaldom made themselves known to her, stifled by wearing an avatar rather than being there in person, warmed up quickly and fed her information. Information about where she was in the world, and maybe, the slightest hint of precognition, like the aftertaste of something she'd not yet eaten.

 &quot;We are close.&quot; She made her avatar stand and look forward, to their ship's destination.

 &quot;And could have come here faster on our own.&quot; Added the Sphinx gruffly. Despite how much larger than Twilight she was, she didn't look down on her physically. A god's self is always slightly above its own head, after all, no mater the incarnate.

 &quot;We have time.&quot; Said Twilight slowly, &quot;Have they truly made self-propelling carts?&quot;

 &quot;And much more. Albaricoque's technology is unrivaled.&quot;

 &quot;I expected to perceive dark magics. But I can feel the knowledge.&quot; Twilight allowed a part of her real selves, both the person and the God, emerge from the Wheels of the World, just to bathe in the feeling. She had almost forgotten its warmth.

The town of Albaricoque neared closer and closer, an island of glass and steel and -much to her pleasure- machined aluminum<span class="Type">[^Alum]</span> floating calmly in the water . It had bubbles for docks, where sirens would allow or deny entrance to any newcomer and, if they allowed it, take ships into the bubbles and take them to the town's underwater entrances. Because of this slums had grown on the edge for all who were waiting passage or had been denied, although they were only slums compared to what Twilight felt in side- the external city looked lively, and not unlike Landly.

 &quot;It'll be a good start.&quot;

 &quot;I would've expected Landly.&quot;

 &quot;Landly needs more resources than I have.&quot; Twilight let more of the god slide out, perceiving more delicate aspects of the town's innards until she felt her feathers stand on end both in the Wheels of the World and in her avatar, and shuddered. &quot;Oh, yes...&quot;

Gods have needs.

This city would satisfy hers. Because as much as it had much knowledge, it also had much to adjust.

Gods had abandoned this world and its people, and in their absence, much had cracked and broken which she'd need a well oiled machine to fix. Such a pity some of the city's cogs would need to be broken and made anew.

<span class="Type">[^Alum]:</span>
Aluminum was a good material. It couldn't be given the same godly properties as bronze, but who cared? It was just <span class="markdownItalic">*</span><span class="markdownItalic">more practical</span><span class="markdownItalic">*</span>, which she found all too many people forgetting.
