That first night after she came back, all four of us sat together at night, on a hill of our lands that we purposefully left to grow wild. Sitting under the stars in that summer night, with food that’d been forgotten pretty much instantly, we looked silently.

My brother was angry. Dad was disappointed— in himself more than me. Mom, though she didn’t want to admit it, was sad, and even when she was holding me tight I knew it was all she could do to not break up in tears.

Sometimes you are a fool, and that’s all there is to say on the mater… that’s something she told me much later, but which both of us knew I understood well after that night stargazing. That she’d shown me handsomely how foolish can one be, and that I’d shown myself as well.

Dad was the one to start. He always is, with his bolstering but calm tone, the same one he’d kept even the time he broken a leg when farming and had instructed my brother, Cress, and me to make a sling. He started easy, just telling us tales related to the constellations, but he insisted until he convinced mom to join in, because everyone knows pegasi from Cloudsdale know all the best tales of every star by heart. And even thought it didn’t immediately make anyone feel better, just the sound of voices was what everyone needed the most that night. Talking. An excuse to feel less awkward and hurt and start putting things aside a little, because all of us knew that much hurt would take a long time to heal, so for now what we had to do was learning to *ignore* it in the meantime. Because we knew that if I didn’t put my anger at mom aside, and Cress his at me, our already weakened family would be torn apart.

And even thought I don’t want to put it this way, even thought I don’t want, I’ve never wanted, to put them under such a bad light, it was because mom was still too frail and dad too strained to put up with our anger. Because they couldn’t be proper parents if we younger ones didn’t put some effort into it too, so when we argued afterwards, when me and Cress even almost traded blows a few times after it, we always were careful of doing it away from dad and mom.

Our family was never ideal. Mom had her issues. Dad was too good at hiding them.

But *darn it*, we put more effort into caring for each other than most ‘ideal’ families do, and I won’t hear otherwise.
