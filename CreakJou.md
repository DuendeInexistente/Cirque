I found the mare Whisper heard about. She really is beautiful: Wings that wouldn't be out of place in Equestria, supple flanks, a flamboyant personality and a nice shade of pink on her mane. I don't think this mare laughs at jokes as much as she laughs at the merry and nonsense of life itself, using jokes a welcome a welcome excuse for it. And, and this is the most curious part, she reminds me of Celestia.

As Whisper was told she has respectable knowledge of legends. I will try to convince her to let me transcribe the legend of the mare in the moon.

She seemed offended that I'd do such a thing, strangely enough: "Paper cannot convey the weight of words or nuance of tone", she said with uncharacteristic seriousness, and some members of her group laughed, I don't know if to me or to her or to life itself.

Still I will copy it as best I can:

#### THE STORY THAT WASN'T, OF THE MARE IN THE MOON

A long time ago Quesque, a bad Cir*, grew bitter on his lighthouse.

Yet the cold breeze of the night warmed his heart, and he talked with the twinkles of the moonstars. Six twinkles were his friends: Leo, Eridanus, Cassiopeia, Lyra, Corvus and Draco. They talked about strange magics and the beauties of their own worlds.

And sometimes the twinkles talked about their sibling as well, The Old Brother. They told him of how he asked them to guide the lost to their destination. The Old Brother, they said, could have either of sexes regardless of his name, or even both, were he to ever descend to the waters below. When Quesque asked why didn't he, the twinkles were silent for many nights before answering.

"It's hard for him. The old brother is more idea than flesh, more fancy than bone. He's the hopes of finding home, for he has known the pain of being lost."

They told him much more, and the more he heard, the more Quesque loved the Big Brother. And after a long time, Quesque said:

 "I live in a lighthouse: Every day, many reach home because of me. Can't I have the honor? Am I not your friend?"

The twinkles agreed to this, and started working on complex magics together with Quesque to guide the Big Brother to the waters. Down there, they said, he'd have sight and tact and and speech and hearing, and because of this he was more impatient than anyone else to be below.

When the moment came, the six twinkles fell before the brother: Each strike to the water produced a great grand splash from which a gift was given.

Cassiopeia birthed the queen-of-tides, so that she would stop the tyranny of the sirens.

The splash of Lyra's drops taught many songs which are still sang, so that our hearts may be lit with merry.

Eridanus made an entire city of clay and glass, it's great spires striking the sky and it's ports open for all to enter.

Corvis drops fell each on a lost sailor, giving them humble cups containing food and the way home.

Leo, fiercest of them all and said to be daughter of the Brother, gave a candle with which to light your way and burn your enemies.

And, last of them all, Draco had a hard time thinking of a gift as great as all others! In her frustration she hit the water again, and again, until from her hits a giant column of water rose to the sky and covered it. It's still there on the sky, protecting us from starfalls so that we may sleep safe.

Last of all fell the Old Brother, now a sister. Her wings spread wide, her horn stood slender and tall, her body supple and her legs strong. She fell on Eridanus' city, crying Corvis' drops, singing Lyra's most perfect song, and her eyes shinning with light and beauty to rival Leo's flame. 

She stood still and crying for a long time, ignoring Quesque's words, He offered food which she did not want, a bed which she did not use, and word which she didn't answer. She stood there for a long time, thinking.

When she spoke, her voice was heard across the world:

"You gave me sight: Because of it, I can see ugliness.

You gave me a voice: Because of it, I can cry.

You gave me hearing: Because of it, I can hear wails.

You gave me tact: Because of it, I can feel pain."

To which Quesque said:

 "We gave you a world in which to see beauty, sing and hear songs, and feel pleasure. Is that not gift enough?"

Which was truth, because while he was an evil Cir, he also felt nothing but honest love for her and couldn't think of trying to hurt her.

Still the Big Sister did not answer, so he offered showing her the world and a way home, and her little sisters convinced her to go with him. Together the eight traveled and saw the world, leaving many warding spells over Quesque's lighthouse.

They saw the beauty of the world, and it's ugliness as well. They saw myst and miasma, rot and birth, songs and wails, lonely deaths and fruitful meetings. And with time, the Big Sister understood the beauty of the world.

How she sang! How she laughed! Each time she did she was more beautiful, alight with a shine that not even divinity could give. And in her happiness, she found home. She and her six sisters returned to the sky, knowing that they could come back, for they were no longer lost, and the light of the moon became ever more shinning, ever more sublime.

### 04 – 10 (?)

Today we arrived to our first whale city. Both me and Whisper have tried to draw it, but neither of us is an artist.

The sheer size of it made it hard for me to accept it as a living being first, at least until it *blinked*, making my heart stop for a moment. If only I still had enough film for the camera...

The city, against my hopes, is nothing like Cloudsdale. Where Cloudsdale is flamboyant, this city is subtle. Where Cloudsdale stands tall and proud, the whalians -As Whisper insists in calling them- shy away from the admittedly mighty winds of this altitude. At times I could even swear the air density is lower here, even when the residents insisted no such thing happens. 

My mother would say, if I want the noises of Canterlot, the people of Canterlot, the sights of Canterlot, why didnt I stay in Canterlot? Yet now that I am in the opposite situation, Cloudsdale is unreachable. Would I hesitate before jumping back to Cloudsdale, even if it meant leaving my house behind? Without a second's doubt. Whisper made me promise as much.

Whalian houses are perhaps the most stark difference. Gone are the arches and open spaces the characterize Cloudsdale, gone are the ceilings that are just another room, gone is all flair. Whalian houses are positively military in nature, and not of the prideful kind: Low, squatting buildings made to resist the winds undamaged, their ceilings semiespherical growths filled with windows to fly off from.

I can understand the reasoning completely, after having had to chase after the chair I forgot outside, and after the wind tore off a page off this very journal. I can understand why are these pegasi so wary and careful of everything, and why, living in the sky, they spend most of the time inside. It still saddens me deeply.

### 04 – 13 (?)

Normally I shy away from writing so early. It affects my writing badly, makes more more rambling than usual: Even, and I quote my mother in this, more purple than Twilight Sparkle.

Yet I must. I am now accompanied by a curious creature, or machine, I can't tell which. It's metallic body is painted pink, and it's made of eight fragments. It has agreed to have a proper conversation with me, which I will write to my transcripts book.

It appeared earlier. I was woken up by a electric storm that woke everyone, short of Whisper of course. Good luck waking up that stallion, with a storm or otherwise.

I went outside and found, as many others, that the thunders were green and purple for some reason. The storm went as it had come, and -has living here made me numb to the fantastic?- I would've forgotten it hadn't the machine creature, similar to a Duda, appeared.

I will admit, much as it hurts to say, that I cried after the conversation. It just hurt so much, letting myself feel hope for even a second.

I had another dream with the griffon's eyes. His eyes, those burning pinpricks, the will o' the wisps of his madness. How can anyone have such a thing? In the orbits of his eyeballs no less, the place that should be empty.

I fear those eyes, those spinning and evermoving eyes. I fear that, if I gazed too deep into them, I'd understand his madness, for madness it is. The madness of perpetual motion, of such a terrible, unyielding decision that I truly believe he's still alive not because of strange magics, but because he stared death on the eye and death backed off.

Those eyes that violate my sleeping mind as much as they violated my sight the single time I saw them.

A machine of purpose. That's the word. He has truly abandoned all that made him equine, Or gri gryphon, more like, in favor of his quest.

I must sleep. The kids will make next morning busy.

### 04 – 15 (?)

The moon! How am I supposed to reach the moon!? That gryphon must be crazy! I knew dreaming about him had to mean something... I told him as much, and he only laughed- A deep bass laugher that, in another time and world, I would've found lovely.

By Celestia, I will kill him one of these days. Just stab him right on the gut he doesn't have.

### 04 – 16 (?)

And what does he think I am!? His Knight Errant? I am not! I am a Celestia-damned writer!

### 04-16

I guess Creek will be mad if I don't do this in her place. We are taking off to the north tomorrow, what cap Sindula called the third corner, and leaving my girls with Wind's aunt. Wouldn't you hear how loud they cry to come with us, poor things.

### 04 - 30

We stopped the house at a city to restock, and while it seemed empty first, now I can hear doors closing wherever we go. There's a foul smell in the air too, like ponyscat.

### 04 - 31

The people of the city burned a body yesterday. It's the first time we see them, and also the first I see an actual burial rather than just sinking the body.

Everyone seemed to be sick. After a while Whisper gathered the courage to ask what was happening, and a foal said they were sick with fungi. His left eye was red and swollen.

It took me several hours to get Whisper to tell me why was the display depressing him as much as it was, even if I a' not unaffected, and when he did talk he was trying to hold back tears. This is the sickness that whipped out changelings, he said. All of them -many his friends- gone in a mater of weeks, the fungi spreading from city to city with the slightest breeze. We've agreed to try getting them help from a nearby city estate, Arabesco.

I asked him about the sickness spreading there, but he said the infection doesn't spread muck anymore. It's main food source is gone, after all, and nowadays it just explodes sometimes.

 
### 04 - 32

A group of medics agreed to at least spare Vivaldi's citizens a withering death. They can't offer more.

My wing itches. Everyone is worried about it, but I don't think it's the fungi.

### 04 - 33 

The medics are going through with the euthanasia of all those who want it… I had to keep myself from vomiting when I saw the parents on the queues. It was just so

Some medics are also trying possible cures, one of them via surgery, but they are the fewer and not many volunteer.

Maybe Equestrian surgeons could remove all the growths, just maybe. This place's can't. 

### 05 - 01

Today I saw someone who didn't take the euthanasia. They are the fewer, and while I wouldn't have said this when I was in Equestria, I don't understand their decision. He was like a bag of water, with some skin hanging on place of his belly and his ribs crearly visible through the skin.

His leg fell off. It was like jello inside, but it didn't bleed. Some hair-like roots hung of the stump. It was the same color as my mane.

I can't eat anything. I don't understand why haven't I flown the home somewhere else. Why
