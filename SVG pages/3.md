One of the ~~only~~ ~~single~~ very few things that are consistent across all accounts of ~~Qu~~ his story is a lighthouse having played a part in things. Sometimes he owned it, not nearly as often he stole it from someone [^dragon] and in one particular case, he built it with... breezies? The wording's not clear about whether or not Breezies helped him build it *or* he literally made bricks out of breezies.

Death of the author, ahoy!

That's depressing.

So he has a tower. It's the old story, big wizard with big tower.  It's how it is, only here I have to deal with mythical forces. Which means it's perfectly logical for it to be just like a story.

Which if you see the story, is also a self-contradiction. Who knows, maybe that's what broke everything! 

[^dragon]:
Note to self: Search versions of the story have named dragons in it. They might be alive if it's real.
