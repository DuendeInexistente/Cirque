One of the ~~only~~ ~~single~~ very few things that are consistent across all accounts of ~~Qu~~ his story is a lighthouse having played a part in things. Sometimes he owned it, not nearly as often he stole it from someone [^dragon] and in one particular case, he built it with... breezies? The wording's not clear about whether or not Breezies helped him build it *or* he literally made bricks out of breezies.

Death of the author, ahoy!

That's depressing.

So he has a tower. It's the old story, big wizard with big tower.  But that tower, what if we could use it to find out way back somehow? He was a Cir, which equals having a *lot* of magic and knowledge at his disposal. Furthemore in a lot of versions the moon is explicitly or implicitly another world in some way.

Note to self: Search versions of the story have named dragons in it. They might be alive if it's real.
