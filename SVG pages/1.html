<p>I had oftimes w<del>a</del>ondered how came I never had to learn any equine, siren, or grip<del>h</del>osic language after being brought to the sea. How much of a coincidence is it that not only two countries, but two <em>worlds</em> speak with the same tongues and very little diference in accents? None of it matched, but among the slews of strangeness that in particular was a little blessing.</p>
<p><del>But Whi</del> Somehow I hadn't considered asking Whisper about this. By the time we met I had almost forgotten about that, I guess, and accepted it as <del>pa</del> just part of the strangeness.</p>
<p>So I was a little confused when I saw Sliver struggle a little to make herself understood by a gr<del>yph</del>ffon.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all them verbs&quot;, said Whisper. &quot;They are weird here.&quot;</p>
<p>I asked him what he meant, of course. And his answer was that while he brought us here, it wasn't necesary that we take <em>all</em> of the hassle of being in a new world. Just the cosmic dread-y part.</p>
<p>Because as unnerving as it is, the languages were put into our heads, somehow. And not only this, but talking with him and Sliver tongues are <em>much</em> looser here. Everyone is at least trilingual, and both foals and adults can learn new languages with disconcerting ease- with speed that one'd normally only ever expect in a five years old in fact.</p>
<p>What's more disconcerting still this trait is not present in either me -well, I did have experience with linguistics before-, Whisper, or either of his daughters. Which means that the structure of our brains -probably wildly diferent from the sea's inhabitants- wasn't altered, but that we simply had the information 'injected' and that this isn't inheritable. <del>Creepy</del> Unnerving still, but not nearly as much.</p>
<p>What's interesting in this is that <del>Ques</del> he didn't think it necessary, or thought it dangerous, to teach us the moonlet/duda bilanguage, and older siren dialects, as well as the local breezie language.</p>
<p>Which still elaves me with the question of how do those little turds survive even, but let's ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>Note to self: Clean this up, transcribe it to jo<del>r</del>urnal, burn the original. So many typos.</strong></p>
