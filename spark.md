The first holder of the Spark was Lucero, for he was the only one left and thus, the sole inheritor. But when the twilight was born unto again, and thought Lucero could've kept it, he said: “What love is there left in my heart?” and before the spark withered in him, gave it to the twilight and went back to the moon.

The twilight gained the spark and, in a tale that was and will be, nearly destroyed it thought her intention was pure. She then gave the spark to another so that the sun could be born unto; this other had nearly died.

But the pony’s laugh and mirth lighted the spark such that the god did not need to alight the sun, and it was brighter than it had ever been before, and for the longest time, the spark was with the sun.

But when the cadence returned, the spark was given to her so her song could be heard clearer and further away, and once her beauty had done all that it could do at the time, the cadence and twilight gave the spark to the six and the one.

Where the spark is now is a mystery, and may be part of a tale that will be.

Who knows.
