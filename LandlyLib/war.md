 While the event that set it off remains a mystery, the trinary war affects 
Dudas and moonlets to this day. It's valid to wonder how exactly were they 
made to fight against each other when before, and since near the end of it, 
they have been close in culture and person; so much, in fact, that they 
share what scholars call bronze bispeech, the same language but "said 
diferent" by moonlets, due to their particular vocal chords. All sources 
I've been able to find point to that understanding Dudas will be an act of 
intuition once I learn enough from Dudas, which makes the proespect all the 
more fascinating [...]

 Going back to the subject of the war, while the triggering event is unknown 
-covered in the same haze of ignorance as everything concerning their 
creator- it's known that the first period of the war lasted aproximately 
fifty years, until moonlets somehow broke out of the servitor doctrine they 
were, quite literally, ingrained into. They were a more recent creation 
-theorized to be meant to replace dudas eventually- yet had made great 
strides, pun not intended, in turning the war against Dudas in their 
creators' favor, partly due to the ingrained flaws moonlets were designed 
with; a lesser ability to focus on individual tasks when not instructed, 
inability to communicate directly with most other peoples, and lethally high 
metabolism all would've greatly helped keep them in servitude effectively.

 It's unknown when does their ritualistic doctrine start appearing- it's 
first reported, of all historical records I can find, in a city state called 
Pehuamar where a battle between Dudas and moonlets takes place. Amidst it 
several moonlets are spotted breaking into a mouna [^mouna] of the big 
brother and stealing several relics And objects of reverence yet ignoring 
greatly more valuable items. At the time it was taken an attack, a warning 
that the war would be not only against Dudas, but against ponies as well.

 Quickly after this similar incidents ocurr, with the moonlets attacking 
mounas and on ocasion even desecrating solairs [^solair] and other chapels. 
Their demeanor changes quickly however, once their aggresions are 
reciprocated; The first case of them acting more peacefuly is in a village 
near what would eventually be the Nikkal storm, taking a prisoner duda (It's 
not described as being harmed, but the written accounts I could find make 
only passing mentions and the sensibilities of the time were largely 
negative towards them) there to be able to communicate. With this 
translator, they are able to communicate and request to enter the place of 
worship peacefuly. Many of the ponies were outraged at this in accordance to 
the zeal of remembrance of the brother, but the deacon of the church finally 
decided to allow them entrance in the condition that they remained peaceful.

 Yet and in what would become common, shortly after this another group of 
moonlets arrives and attacks the worshipers, moonlets and ponies alike. As 
moonlets and dudas had not yet largely adopted writing into their culture 
all accounts of this are at best conflicting, at worst missleading, about 
what is that revolted their cultures so strongly, but it's during this that 
the previously loyalist moonlets become increasingly religious in their cult 
worship of the moon lord, apparently to spite their creator, and fraction 
into rebelious parties.

 With this the war becomes properly trinary-- it's no longer moonlets and 
comparatively less dudas fighting for their creators against dudas, but 
three separate fronts for much of the remainer of the war; Dudas who rebeled 
[^kalb] , miscelanious loyalists, and Moonlets who despite having rebelled 
as well, refused to join in with the Tayirs after the heienous crimes that 
each faction had commited against the other during the war.

 This separation however only seems to be benefitial. Moonlets continue to 
divide into smaller groups that nonetheless manage varying degrees of 
coordination and practice guerrilla warfare against loyalists, keeping 
their troops in disarray. This comes to ruination of Tayirs on ocasion, but 
as time goes on they come closer together to the point that even if they are 
still largely independant, tayirs and moonlets can communicate effectively 
enough to be effective together in battle as, if not an united front, a 
collection of fronts with inclusive goals. [^divide]

 The war came to a conclusion quickly after this; loyalist forces were chaos 
as they attempted to fight to many cooperating groups with their 
methodologies. Several (Verbal, of course, and thus not very reliable) 
colections go as far as to recount loyalist generals being unable to 
remember who had they fought in the morning by the time night fell. [...]


[^mouna][^solair]:A chapel dedicated to the worship of the big brother as 
ponies perceive him. Sometimes it's wrongly seen as opposite of solairs, 
where the big sister is worshiped in a similar fashion, but historically 
both worships have been non-exclusive and in some cases even complementary, 
bar particular incidents such as this and more recent developments following
Patzivota appearing and the Big Brother betraying the duality.

[^kalb]:Sources of the time indicate that there were parties pushing for 
them to call themselves Tayir or Kalb, marking the divide between them and 
those who remained obeying their creators, but neither seems to have struck 
as much more than a curiosity in their culture. They will from now on be 
referred to as Tayirs however, for ease of reading.

[^divide]:The not-quite-divide among them is something that lasts to modern 
days, where they have a common culture but largely separate lifestyles; Duda 
crews are largely singular, that is, a single family working under the 
supervision of their parent with little if any external asistance, while 
moonlets often are employed by ponies into their crews and rarely own 
private property that would impede their wanderlust.
