### Cursed people

 [...]The first reported appearnse of one of the assumed "Steixians", or as thei are more kommonli (giet less kreativelee) kalled "uater ponies" is during the festival of kards in Auenkal, uitsh thei assumely sniked into bi means of suvtterfush, uere they join in the merrimaking, despite the lahk of invite uitsh I am asked to sai, is very rude and ill-manered.

 Despait this rudness and mai be unauhare of it thei join happili, drinking mani & verili varied drinks among them, and made mutsh merrei in \*, fighting also uith thous ~~ghu~~ ~~ju~~ hu made atemps at their selves. I uas also told, by somone ju asked to not be named, a verili reproatshable attitude of these times, that no less than three of diverse sexes bedded uith thes steixians, & this is hou thei discovered the steixians uere not in fact wearing disguises mutsh to the uonder of \* & also mine.

 Soon after thei appear in other lokales sutsh as alende's fall, landlee, diverse koloneis, & many plases in mutsh similar uais. Som kneu this among them me, ! Uhen ue asked of their origins, thei deftili didn not ansuer & avoided us longili ever sinse.

 Kuriosli enoug sirens didn not like them mutsh, uitsh is to sai, thei fastli ualk out of the room if thei are nearbi & do not look bak. Thei don not knou uere the steixians kame from or if thei knou, thei jave not told and sim realful uhen thei sai, thei just don nt leik them. Also to mention is, uile some sai thei aer al leeing, I don not see it leikli that not one of them sais the trut even bi mistake.

 Homuever & verili sadli, tshangerlings jave goun sik & manei efforts goe einto finding out ui & hou, & hou kan thei be kured, bekaus mani die eatsh dai & mani arts uold be lost if tei uent auai. I do homuever promise to return to attempting unveiling the sourse of steixians as after a solution has ben found, homuever.
