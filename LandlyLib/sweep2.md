It's so smooth, it's so fluid, to move in these nights when the moon shines just enough that you can see the littlest bit ahead and you don't know, you don't know what may be beyond the fog that covers Landly like it's the stage of an ancient opera, where they use those small masks that somehow fool everyone but it's so pretty that they do.

And there it is- the portico with a stone door, a known safety, not many of those when I am wearing the suit, and I still dread it the littlest bit. We don't know them- those locks all over Landly. Those strange puzzles that can unlock one's way into riches, who knows their operation? Any attempts to dismantle them go awry, scholars can't make heads or tails of how they work, and we still use them. Mostly for illegal things- some of which even I shudder at.

Ha. Who am I to criticise?

But it's a small comfort, as I search blindly for the circle pieces hidden behind a column, it's a small comfort that this one isn't used for anything bad. Storage, sometimes sleeping, but never have we allowed anything illegal to happen in here. Don't shit where you eat, says the old adage. 

Why did Lettuce Leaf name me Sweeper? Is it the cape? But he uses one too. Or is it a joke from afar, from the land he jabbers about? Maybe, probably. It doesn't really bear thinking- I wouldn't expect an insult from him of all people after all. It's nice enough that he likes the games we play.

There are hideouts in a few cities, but Landly is the only one that actively tries to kills you. The floor divides under me as soon as I've opened the lock, moving my hooves apart from each other awkwardly before I have the time to hop to prevent that, and then I fall down a tunnel. The fall is rough, and hurts my knees a little, but I have no time to think about it because -forgetting the fluid movement for an instant- I have to jump forward, barely escaping the closing walls that would've otherwise crushed the life out of me.

It's like being the character of an old song, like being a silvery bit of moonlight, that's what being this feels like. Why can't people understand romance anymore? I bite on my wrists and pull the right spot of the bands to untie them, feeling warmth wash over my hooves when the tight knots come undone. My joints ache not only from the bad blood flow, but because it's irresistible, you hear, it's irresistible, when I wear this suit, to be a little more wistful and looser and flexible and acrobatic. Everything I do could be done with half the effort, maybe less, but why? Why not play once the game's started?

Maybe I am too old for this. I untie the knot under my hat and my mouth piece, cloth wound so tight you couldn't tell it's separate from the rest at all, falls to the floor and allows me to breath freely. It's suffocating. It's still so pretty.

What isn't pretty is this hallway. White stone with no light sources, just a dark stretch before entering the hideout proper. The room after it is at best drab, also plain stone, and I feel a moment of nostalgia at my wood panelled study, where I've planned so many heists. I've been away from home for much too long, and everyone is probably worrying while I have fun.

There are convex spots on the wall, and circular holes on the floor there too- this room was originally used for something I've as of yet been unable to guess, other than there
