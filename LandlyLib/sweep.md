 A dark figure slid into a dark portico fast and fluid like quicksilver, searching blindly with a hoof. There were many strange doors in Landly, with equally strange locks that weren't always understandable in their function or even operation. And while some were seized by scholars who attempted -without success- to gain insight into their inner workings, most were unreported, taken over by someone- rarely with quite legal purposes.

 In that, the pony -Who still wondered why had Lettuce Leaf decide to name them Sweeper- thought this was better used than most. Nothing nefarious happened inside their hideout, as far as they knew. Don't shit where you eat. And with their hideouts in several cities, despite Sweeper's effort to keep it varied, they always half expected someone to figure out a pattern and bust them for good.

 The expectation gave them a sense of trepidation.

 Finally they spun the triangle of circles in the right way and the floor moved under them; The elaborate door in front was probably a carved piece of the wall, but even knowing this, having the floor move under them always caught them by surprise, if not off-guard. It always took an arbitrary amount of time to react to the password.

 And when they fell, a few feet below, they rolled out of the hole immediately, barely escaping being crushed by the walls when they closed again.

 Then they stopped and breathed, allowing themselves a small utterance- pained and tired. The mouth piece was the first to be taken off to breathe more comfortably. Then -walking- they bit and pulled from the appropriate spot of the bands tied around their wrists, allowing their blood to circulate properly and reducing the ache on their joints. It wasn't just that the suit, despite being made of lithe cloths, was hot and tight. It was that while wearing it, Sweeper couldn't help showing off. Moving more fancily, adding a bounce to their steps. It was just too fun not to do, even when melancholy stroke as hard as it would time and time again.

 The hallway was mostly unlit, but clean, and had no ornaments besides the small arc at its exit. They often wondered what had this place been used for originally- the two rooms were spacious, separated by a wall and with several convex points on the wall that, by the markings on the floor, had once kept cilinders in place. On the corners of the room were burners, alight with white flames that never ran out of whatever fueled them. One of them had once theorized -over a bottle of fine wine- that it fed on the 'life' of anyone who was close enough, but Sweeper -Really, why that name? Was it the cape?- doubted it. The burners didn't make them feel particularly tired.
 
 But the place had been ransacked down to Styx long before they were born, they thought as they took off the hat. They turned their hoof like a magician showing off and the hat twirled behind their wrist, but wasn't seen coming out at the other sideâ€¦ other than the long red feather they always wore, which was flung  morosely the other side without the rest of the hat anchoring it.
 
 It had a bit if dust on it. Sweeper made a theatrical display of dismay before picking it up, remembered that no one was watching, and caught it feeling a fit of self conscientiousness. Dust, how was dust sticking to it?
 
 No one understood romance these days, and like the dust, this stole shine and glamour from the world. Sweeper caught themselves feeling suddenly and irrationally angry about it not for the first time. Once people had known the heights  an ideal can drive you to reach, but now they thought of it as silly and childish, not understanding that an ideal isn't chased to reach it. An ideal is a light that takes you everywhere else in the process.
 
 ~~Why did people deny themselves something as pretty as that? As magical? And it was buggering that the stallion, Lettuce, seemed to have better luck at finding others like himself who understood it. Everyone in his little group was desperately romantic, sans maybe the young duda. The forget-me-not was the most overt about it,~~
 
 They took a deep breath to calm down and whipped the feather to clean the dust. It should've broken from the strength of the movement, but like romanticism, like a fortunate meeting or a dance at midnight, the feather was much more resiliant than it might've been apparent with its long and hollow stalk.
