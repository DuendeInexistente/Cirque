## Main party

#### Lettuce Leaf
![](Images/Papers/Leaf1.png) ![](Images/Papers/Leaf2.png)

An Equestrian cook and farmer who may be too patient with people and who will try to talk the dragon out of keeping the princess captive, but is having to learn to apply violence the hard way. After a mysterious incident, he was transported to the sea and is now trying to find a way back.

He does not want any super-mystic fate-of-the-world crap.

#### Herb
![](Images/Papers/Herb1.png)

A forget-me-not bird with little respect for personal space who's much more perceptive about people than may be apparent, and for whom life is just another tale. His entire culture revolves around storytelling and it shows-- even as he searches his way back he is still compiling, cross referencing, making up, and telling stories in the library that is his head.
