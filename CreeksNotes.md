[...]Consider then the assumed nature of alicorns, who hold inside the three-spirits-that-are-four: A pony is contemplative yet ruthless, the pegasus wild and ecstatic, the unicorn fiery yet focused. These are [...] conflictive by nature, and it's not mere cultural traits: It's [...] a product of how their magics operate and affect their predisposition.[...]

It comes to reason then that alicorns are, by nature, *holistic* creatures, as it takes a great mind, resilient body, and trained soul to congeal those three spirits into the fourth, the alicornian spirit; A spirit that's indomitable and, of course, part of the world.

Which is no mere poetry. For them to not sublimate this disparity, but to mold and congeal it into a single coherent fourth entity that still remains separate from the other three, both internal and external pressure must be require: Inner is their own will and beauty, but outer must be a <u>mythical force</u> of duality, union, or harmony of some sort that presses them at all times to remain whole[...]

It's all this that supports the theory of [...] the pony goddesses -The dual duality of the sun and moon, rock and water- being, did they have physical forms, alicorns. Their longevity would give them the time to forge themselves into iron, and their roles mean that the required forces to forge them again are an inherent part of their persons.
