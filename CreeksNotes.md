"[...]However, the nature of an alicorn -did they exist- is holistic [...], undetachable from the aspect to which they are bound. Great magics and souls are needed to balance inherently conflicting magics of ponies, pegasi, and unicorns: The pegasus spirit is wild and ecstatic, the pony calm and contemplative, the unicorn fiery and focused, and this nature is not a mere cultural trait but [...] a product of the nature of their inherent magic. What kind of soul could, then, could not only balance them but make a new soul -an alicornian soul- out of the balance therein, a fourth emerging from the sum of the parts?

It is for this reason that they are beings of both conflict and resolution both [...] within the same body; As lady Scheherazade -praised be her wings and mane- once put it, a solved riddle[...]

But even with a mind that could control such spirits and a body that could weather them, alicorns are -for it is privy to me what the approximate functional composition of one is- deeply ingrained into [...] aspects of the world. This is not religions babbling as I was initially led to believe, but something that stems from their holistic nature: *mythical forces* of unification and balance must apply external pressure onto the whole to mold it into a single coherent entity[...]

Compare then [...] the difference between an *incarnate* and a *god*. Gods in their oldest depictions of pony mythology are always alicorns, yet incarnates are distinguished by preternatural elegance and beauty but, also, merely equine agents of the gods. Griffons, have no such creature, yet their gods are always duos corresponding to the two mythological creatures from which they descend.









[...]Consider then the assumed nature of alicorns, who hold inside the three-spirits-that-are-four: A pony is contemplative yet ruthless, the pegasus wild and ecstatic, the unicorn fiery yet focused. These are [...] conflictive by nature, and it's not mere cultural traits: It's [...] a product of how their magics operate and affect their predisposition.[...]

It comes to reason then that alicorns are, by nature, *holistic* creatures, as it takes a great mind, resilient body, and trained soul to congeal those three spirits into the fourth, the alicornian spirit; A spirit that's indomitable and, of course, part of the world.

Which is no mere poetry. For them to not sublimate this disparity, but to mold and congeal it into a single coherent fourth entity that still remains separate from the other three, both internal and external pressure must be require: Inner is their own will and beauty, but outer must be a <u>mythical force</u> of duality, union, or harmony of some sort that presses them at all times to remain whole[...]

It's all this that supports the theory of [...] the pony goddesses -The dual duality of the sun and moon, rock and water- being, did they have physical forms, alicorns. Their longevity would give them the time to forge themselves into molten iron, and their roles mean that the required forces to forge them are an inherent part of their persons.
