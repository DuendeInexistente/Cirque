And no, I didn't add emojii to the headers. Gitbook's the one adding them.

Changelog:

16/10/17: Players have found [something](https://duendeinexistente.gitbooks.io/cirque/content/World.svg), and received the wooden diaries, which still aren't fully finished.

22/12/17: Made a few small corrections and tweaked the index (Visible in the sidebar) in preparation for adding new content.
