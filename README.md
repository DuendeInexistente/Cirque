And no, I didn't add emojii to the headers. Gitbook's the one adding them.

Changelog:

16/10/17: Players have found [something](https://duendeinexistente.gitbooks.io/cirque/content/World.svg), and received the wooden diaries, which still aren't fully finished.

22/12/17: Made a few small corrections and tweaked the summary (The sidebar when reading books) in preparation for adding new content.

27/12/17: I wave off the year with new content.

2/1/18: Restored the short stories, which I apparently removed from the summary at some point, in a more user-friendly format.

13/1/18: Added one more story. And realizing that I didn't do this before, the new material is:

 - [Three](ScrambledPages/1.md) [new](ScrambledPages/2.md) [pages](ScrambledPages/3.md) of Creek's journal.
 - [A short story about starry skies.](ShortStories/stars.md)
 - Added a [character list](/meta/characters.md)
