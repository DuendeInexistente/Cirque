### Shallow Shoals

> "The shallow shoals?"
> 
> "Of course, but it's on warmer waters." Necia talks over Bedside, "I've never gone there because the sea isn't too deep and sirens don't have as many cities as here.. but you can even see the bottom there on a clear day. Some ponies like that."
> 
> [...]
> 
>"The city's famous for never being invaded... the shallows are too risky and ships sink without a lighthouse on, and swimming below them isn't possible at night."

### Fire Mountains

> "Mountains...? Oh, yes, mountains, further west... under the sea, large mountains... mountains-of-fire, for eggs..." He nods. "Mothers, many mothers, protect them inside... inside and out."
> 
> "Inside? How do they do that?"
> 
> "The sirens dig for us... in exchange for protection, and we can enter the..." He whispers in several other languages again, "rivers of flame, filled with enough... heat and magic to hatch the eggs."

### Lanka

> "Oh. Lanka, bunch of yahoos." She shakes her head, smirking, "What kind of pony builds a city where no building can be over ten feet, then makes a hundred feet tower on it's center? Genially crazy ponies, that's who."

> *The sheer size of it made it hard for me to accept it as a living being first, at least until it *blinked*, making my heart stop for a moment. If only I still had enough film for the camera...*
> 
> *The city, against my hopes, is nothing like Cloudsdale. Where Cloudsdale is flamboyant, this city is subtle. Where Cloudsdale stands tall and proud, the Whalians -As Whisper insists in calling them- shy away from the admittedly mighty winds of this altitude. At times I could even swear the air density is lower here, even when the residents insisted no such thing happens.*

### Albaricoque

> "Albaricoque. They have this thing on their city, a pile o' wood." She laughs. "Not joking! It's this pillar made of wood with green stuff in it? And food grows off it. But good luck getting anywhere near it."

Once
<br>when I
<br>was young
<br>and didn't
<br>ask much,
<br>I went to
<br>small Coracao
<br>and danced
<br>all night long
<br><br>
<br>In the morn
<br>I asked
<br>why had we
<br>danced.
<br>And a filly
<br>all tears and laugh,
<br>tells me I swear
<br>"I miss him so much."
<br>"But what would our angels
<br>rise to the stars on,
<br>If it's not our laugher and dance
<br>'cause we love 'em so much."

### Samabaj

>"Hey, Leaf!" The Star glides to you. "Did you know they have three dimensional cities?" 
> 
>"Our construction is not as limited as that of ponies," Adds Necia. "The tallest castle is almost on the surface.
