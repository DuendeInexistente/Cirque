Water flows.

Fish swim under my shack, some of them chasing other ones.m— long, flexible, an eel dashes like a clay arrow after a carp, itself chased by a foal-sized, dense mass… an urban dolphin. The threefold hunt whirls like circles of light within my awareness of the water—

Big.

I focus on it, push everything away to pull the feeling closer. Big, but not that much, almost gelatinous in consistency. A tentacle shoots of it upwards and catches the carp.

Squid, not the prey I still crave for, and probably made poisonous by the city. I wonder if Leaf could do something interesting with it nonetheless.

Water flows.

 "You seem nervous." Comes the duda's, Natan's, voice from near Far away… maybe. The reverberation in his voice makes it harder to tell where he is, as with all of his kind.

I open my mouth.

 "What a surprise." Says the small duda that follows Natan around. It seems to assume none of us understand it.

I remain silent. No sense in echoing it.

 "What did she say?" Asks the star, whatever it is. 

 "Just a joke." Says Natan, avid to avoid the topic. "Leaf?"

 "Just Uhm, still getting used to it." He taps something heavy and wet, probably my shark.

Why does Natan avoid translating what the other one says? Why does it avoid each of the star's questions on the topic? Is it interested in keeping the small duda separated from everyone else?

I don't understand, nor is there anything for me to start trying. The star would die to get Far away home, the bird for some romantic idea no one cares about, or maybe just to be annoying. I would die glad if it was in a good enough hunt, Leaf for… whatever ideal he happens to be overthinking, maybe for m—

But what does the duda value enough to die for? The little one? Is the isolation to protect it?

Isolation doesn't protect. Isolation stunts.

And the star, is she still angry over the bet? Am I supposed to do something about that, is everybody expecting that from me? Is it not enough that I gave her the prize I earned?  

Water flows.

  "Sea?" Asks Far away nervously, a soft sound of brushing I still haven't identified coming from the grass under him. "I know you hunted it and all, but…"

 "Get to it."

 "Can you, er," Just how can this stallion add nervous pauses to everything? And I thought he was improving. "Cut it?"

 "Cut it."

 "I think he means butchering." Adds Natan.

  "That makes me think of movie killers." Says Leaf under his breath, and I decide to ignore the comment. Is it some sort of praise? Or something underhanded?

Nah, he doesn't have it to be underhanded.

I walk to the shark, knife in mouth, and open it's abrasive skin carefuly avoiding to touch it with my bare skin. Most of the cutting is done holding the knife tip against it, searching the spots I know by tact and memory. The stomach and intestines go out, as sharks are too stupid to know what to not eat, and I fall into a lull of irreflexive motion. Up, down, deeper, off with the jaw, leaving it aside for easy reach…

Water flows.

A shape comes to us through it, sized like a pony but longer and lighter, moving gracefully. What is it? Habit and instinct both make me tense, ready for a hunt, tighten my jaws around the knife but remain still until the moment I have a concrete direction to attack. It's teeth are sharp, but smaller than a shark's— cutting the dirty water that enters it's mouth.

Water flows.

It jumps to Leaf's grass, still covered in enough water for my perception to pick it up, and I waste no time: an explosion of motion, and my knife has dug a milometer or two into it's scales when I stop it.

It's not trying to attack and it whimpers, with a voice that's too complex to be mere animal's. But it's a fish—!

A siren?

 "Sea!" Says the star.

No blood comes off the wound, which didn't penetrate past the scales anyway. Only trembling.

Water flows.

I take the knife off her neck and spit it to my hoof to talk, "you aren't prey." I say, mildly peeved but hoping it'll convey  my lack of interest in hunting her now. It's always irritating when people cowers around me.

 "Sea!" Says Leaf. No, he squeaks it. A little choked would-be shout.

Is he only reacting now?

I return to butchering quietly… once I find the shark again. The sudden movement made me lose my sense of direction.

Water flows.
