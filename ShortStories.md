# Flow.
### (And how it might betray you)

Water flows.

Fish swim under my shack, some of them chasing other ones— long, flexible, an eel dashes like a clay arrow after a carp, itself chased by a foal-sized, dense mass… an urban dolphin. The threefold hunt whirls like circles of light within my awareness of the water—

Big.

I focus on it, push everything away to pull the feeling closer. Big, but not that much, almost gelatinous in consistency. A tentacle shoots of it upwards and catches the carp.

Squid, not the prey I still crave for, and probably made poisonous by the city. I wonder if Leaf could do something interesting with it nonetheless.

Water flows.

 "You seem nervous." Comes the duda's, Natan's, voice from near Far away… maybe. The reverberation in his voice makes it harder to tell where he is, as with all of his kind.

I open my mouth.

 "What a surprise." Says the small duda that follows Natan around. It seems to assume none of us understand it.

I remain silent. No sense in echoing it.

 "What did she say?" Asks the star, whatever it is. 

 "Just a joke." Says Natan, avid to avoid the topic. "Leaf?"

 "Just Uhm, still getting used to it." He taps something heavy and wet, probably my shark.

Why does Natan avoid translating what the other one says? Why does it avoid each of the star's questions on the topic? Is it interested in keeping the small duda separated from everyone else?

I don't understand, nor is there anything for me to start trying. The star would die to get Far away home, the bird for some romantic idea no one cares about, or maybe just to be annoying. I would die glad if it was in a good enough hunt, Leaf for… whatever ideal he happens to be overthinking, maybe for m—

But what does the duda value enough to die for? The little one? Is the isolation to protect it?

Isolation doesn't protect. Isolation stunts.

And the star, is she still angry over the bet? Am I supposed to do something about that, is everybody expecting that from me? Is it not enough that I gave her the prize I earned?  

Water flows.

  "Sea?" Asks Far away nervously, a soft sound of brushing I still haven't identified coming from the grass under him. "I know you hunted it and all, but…"

 "Get to it."

 "Can you, er," Just how can this stallion add nervous pauses to everything? And I thought he was improving. "Cut it?"

 "Cut it."

 "I think he means butchering." Adds Natan.

  "That makes me think of movie killers." Says Leaf under his breath, and I decide to ignore the comment. Is it some sort of praise? Or something underhanded?

Nah, he doesn't have it to be underhanded.

I walk to the shark, knife in mouth, and open it's abrasive skin carefuly avoiding to touch it with my bare skin. Most of the cutting is done holding the knife tip against it, searching the spots I know by tact and memory. The stomach and intestines go out, as sharks are too stupid to know what to not eat, and I fall into a lull of irreflexive motion. Up, down, deeper, off with the jaw, leaving it aside for easy reach…

Water flows.

A shape comes to us through it, sized like a pony but longer and lighter, moving gracefully. What is it? Habit and instinct both make me tense, ready for a hunt, tighten my jaws around the knife but remain still until the moment I have a concrete direction to attack. It's teeth are sharp, but smaller than a shark's— cutting the dirty water that enters it's mouth.

Water flows.

It jumps to Leaf's grass, still covered in enough water for my perception to pick it up, and I waste no time: an explosion of motion, and my knife has dug a millimeter or two into it's scales when I stop it.

It's not trying to attack and it whimpers, with a voice that's too complex to be mere animal's. But it's a fish—!

A siren?

 "Sea!" Says the star.

No blood comes off the wound, which didn't penetrate past the scales anyway. Only trembling.

Water flows.

I take the knife off her neck and spit it to my hoof to talk, "you aren't prey." I say, mildly peeved but hoping it'll convey  my lack of interest in hunting her now. It's always irritating when people cowers around me.

 "Sea!" Says Leaf. No, he squeaks it. A little choked would-be shout.

Is he only reacting now?

I return to butchering quietly… once I find the shark again. The sudden movement made me lose my sense of direction.

Water flows.

# Grief 
### (A possible outcome, years down the road)

Natan entered the kitchen and, before even being fully aware of what was happening, took the spear tip off Leaf's hooves. His recently bent leg nearly made him lose balance.

Silence.

Dripping. Blood and tears.

Natan threw the spear tip away, not caring of where it fell, and put a hand over Leaf's shoulder.

His neck bled. It wasn't deep enough a wound to worry about, certainly not the deepest.

Someone entered the kitchen and exited immediately.

Dripping. Sobbing.

Natan pulled him into a hug.

Wounded flesh he didn't know the pain off, but he did aching hearts.

---

Leaf shouted, his wings smoking as he flung them again, again, thunder screaming off them like vicious whips, spear on his hooves. Natan could only try to cover his back as the Pegasus forgot all about defence to repel their assailants, well trained flotilla soldiers bearing crescent moon badges.

Leaf shouted. Cried. He stopped fighting, and fell silent.

Someone climbed Natan's large chassis, and someone else, and another in a growing pile of armored bodies that was quickly becoming too heavy for him to move despite his size.

"Leaf!"

No answer.

An earth pony was readying a sword aimed at Leaf's chest. Natan's chassis was starting to buckle under the heavily armored ponies.

Bronze steps over grass.

Nitzan charged onto the would-be killer of Leaf, her steel-plated shoulder hitting his head with a loud clang. Others, also of Natan's crew, took care of the ponies pilling over him.

The battle over, Nitzan looked at Leaf silently for a moment and walked away, the word in her mind clear in the enraged way she moved.

'Weak.'

"Leaf?" Asked Natan, walking uncomfortably with a damaged chassis, bent leg, and cracked lens.

The Pegasus only stared at the body in front of him, both completely silent. Blood streamed off both.

Leaf's, from a myriad of wounds.

The soldier's, from the spear in his gut.

"I hate this." Said Leaf quietly, apathetically.

Natan put a hand on his shoulder.

"I hate her."

"It's fine."

"It's my fault."

Natan tightened his grip, "it's not."

 "You don't know that."

Nitzan returned, carrying a tied stallion.

"Got the Captain." She dropped Victor on the grass and walked off again, not deigning give a last glance to Leaf.

---

The doors of the restaurant opened with a bang. The patrons looked at the newcomer with a mix of emotions, then relaxed. Only the owner.

Nitzan looked away from the griffon she was talking with, "Far away?" She asked curiously. He wasn't due for another day.

Natan didn't need to ask. Leaf dragged his wings, held his head low, had reddened eyes, carried the spear.

"I," He started, voice dry. "I would like to ask," A sob cut him, "To ask for five minutes of—"

He stopped talking, some clarity shining in his eyes, and walked to Natan at the bar.

"What am I doing." He asked quietly to no one.

Nitzan talked, the griffon forgotten. "Where's Sea?"

 "She'd say, 'Why should they care.'" Leaf ignored her. "Not even ask it. Just say it."

Natan turned around and asked the patrons to return later, reimbursing their orders. The musicians didn't need to be told to stop playing. It wasn't a night for business.

# It's only natural.
### (Of a grown up to have some needs)

Leaf swung her tail splashing, hot water around the bathroom, and searched around blindly for a towel. *Say what you may about the sea*, he thought, *but at least the towels are great. And they all smell of Cinnamon for some reason.* No shampoo, though. And he didn't trust what was used around these parts.

A door opened somewhere else in the house-- Cas' house, actually, so it wasn't hard to guess who it was. Then the bathroom door opened, which was only so surprising seeing as how this was Cas of all mares.

 "Thanks for letting me use it," He said shyly, sliding away from the her. Cas was back home, and not quite sober from the way she walked. "I--"

 "What if," She stopped talking for a split second, "What if you thank me more directly."

 "Cas, please." Leaf repeated the phrase that was starting to turn into a mantra when near her. "You are drunk."

 "Only a little spiked." She said pleasantly.

 "Don't you think this is a little sudden?" His flanks hit a corner of the room. "Don't you think all of your, uhm--"

 "Crush?" She offered.

 "Don't you think it was kinda fast from you?"

 "Maaaybe?" She singsonged, but stopped advancing to him.

 "How do you know I am not the wrong guy?"

 "Leaf, I am good at judging ponies. I got to be."

 "Er, how so?" He asked, backed into a literal corner and hoping to stall her.

 "Oh, my job, my job…" She rolled her eyes, "I have to tell if a pony's dangerous the moment I see them."

 "Really?"

 "Always somewhere dark and at night" She rolled her eyes. "But it's the way things work."

 "Uh." 

 "Not as many mares as you'd think." She seemed confused by this.

 "Cas?" Said Leaf, realizing that she hadn't even mentioned working before.

 "You know what do I want to do?" Asked Cas, "Do it on the day too."

 "On the day?" He couldn't help asking.

 "Where everyone can see it." She said, still talking pleasantly, then hiccuped. "It'd be so… So daring."

Leaf didn't answer, only blushing deeply.

 "Are you okay?" She asked, as if remembering that he was there at all.

 "It'sOkayIWon'tJudge." He said without thinking.

 "I knew you wouldn't." She pulled him into a clumsy hug. "You are a good friend, Leaf."

The physical contact felt awkward after the revelation, but Leaf forced himself to relax and, against his expectations, found it soothing, "Thanks."

 "You'll get back home." She said.

 "Thanks."

 "You know what, your friend'd be good at it too."

The awkwardness returned.

 "She's got the physique, now she'd only need subtlety." She wandered off another drunken tangent. "And maybe a wardrobe too."

The mental image Leaf got wasn't unpleasant, but it wasn't one he felt comfortable with either.

 "Will you stay for dinner?" Asked Cas. "Have I tasted your cooking yet?" She paused for effect, eyes lidded. "I'd also like your co--"

 "I got to go." He said suddenly, surprised by it himself. "I er got to practice and, uh, to practice."

 "See you later." She walked off the bathroom unfazed.

Leaf walked home, trying unsuccessfully not to imagine Cas and Sea in scant clothing.
