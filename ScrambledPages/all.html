<p>I found another myth:</p>
<p>First came the stars: And from them was birthed their father, for all was naught and life was upside down. Their shine was the first hint of light to be seen, and the one that guided the moon to it’s first orbit. It was with this that night was made.</p>
<p>Once that the moon had come the light was too weak still, so at first the moon fell with an aching song but then hung by the thin silver threads that the stars had strung around his neck, and his swinging from the threads was the second orbit of the moon: ????? in their own tongue or ??????????????? <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>And with the swaying and swinging of the father-son a firmness-before-the-moon was needed, so next came the elder sister: twilight, stone-and-mortar. Twilight had no orbits or swaying and hung from no threads that it did not choose to, and it was in this firmness and confidence that she became liaison between god and mortal, and the first holder of the spark.</p>
<p>Being preceded by twilight gave the night moon respite for he could now lay his legs on her land<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and he trashed much less as he swung. This was his third orbit.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Twilight then tried to use her spark to lay light upon the land so that the minds and hearts of all could see:<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> But the spark, however nurtured it was, was not made for such things. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> And while twilight understood that she had misused the spark and nearly broken it and herself, she was greatly displeased not because of her own misuse, but because of the inadequacy of her tools.</p>
<p>This is why the first halves of the dualities were flawed.</p>

<p>I had oftimes w<del>a</del>ondered how came I never had to learn any equine, siren, or grip<del>h</del>osic language after being brought to the sea. How much of a coincidence is it that not only two countries, but two <em>worlds</em> speak with the same tongues and very little diference in accents? None of it matched, but among the slews of strangeness that in particular was a little blessing.</p>
<p><del>But Whi</del> Somehow I hadn’t considered asking Whisper about this. By the time we met I had almost forgotten about that, I guess, and accepted it as <del>pa</del> just part of the strangeness.</p>
<p>So I was confused when I saw Sliver struggle a little to make herself understood by a gr<del>yph</del>ffon, a while ago. I hadn’t seen this before.</p>
<p>“It’s all them verbs”, said Whisper. “They are weird here.”</p>
<p>I asked him what he meant, of course. And his answer was that while <del>Q</del>He brought us here, it wasn’t necessary that we take <em>all</em> of the hassle of being in a new world. Just the cosmic dread-y part.</p>
<p>Because as unnerving as it is, the languages were put into our heads, somehow. And not only this, but talking with him and Sliver tongues are <em>much</em> looser here. Everyone is at least trilingual, and both foals and adults can learn new languages with disconcerting ease,</p>
<p>What’s more disconcerting still this trait is not present in either me -although I had experience with linguistics before-, Whisper, or either of his daughters. Which means that our brains weren’t altered, but that we simply had the information ‘injected’ and that this isn’t inheritable. <del>Creepy</del> Unnerving still, but not nearly as much.</p>
<p>What’s interesting in this is that <del>Ques</del> He didn’t think it necessary -or thought it dangerous- to teach us the moonlet/duda bilanguage, older siren dialects, or the local breezie language.</p>
<p>Which still leaves me with the question of how do <del>those little</del> they survive at all anywhere, but let’s ignore it. I can only question the cosmos so much.</p>
