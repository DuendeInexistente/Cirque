Very recently I met a curious pony. ~~S~~ he was tall and had wings like old Queen Schezerade's tales narrate. This pony, named "Before Storm" -when I asked the meaning of it, ~~s~~ he alluded to it being a long story-  attracted my attention in one of Landly's canteens and, over much drink, told me his story.

He claims to hail from seas called 'Land', which is not water but a seemingly endless surface. His city is named Pegasopolis, which he claims, is at war with unicorns and ponies, whom he calls "Eartherns." Through some twist of destiny, he and his entire household -which due to bad luck was not garrisoned- were transported here, bypassing the extreme distance that we both agreed must separate us seeing as how no common point could be agreed by us. He did not know even the cold or warm seas, and I cannot fathom what a 'desert' is as much as he tried to explain it.

We discussed the differences between the cold seas and the land's for several hours
